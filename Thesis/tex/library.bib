abstract = {In ecology, camera trapping is commonly used as a non-invasive technique to collect ecological observation data and to monitor populations. The technique is used to address a variety of research questions worldwide. Despite being widely used, few studies have evaluated the potential effects of camera traps on animals, and to my knowledge no studies have quantified to what extent and under which conditions such effects occur. In this thesis, I have assessed the behavior of two large carnivores in Norway, Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) and wolf (Canis lupus), using still images captured by camera traps. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the presence of camera traps can cause behavioral changes in wildlife. I recorded behaviors that indicated apparent detection of cameras by visual and/or acoustic contact. Furthermore, other distinct behaviors towards camera was assessed, in addition to the orientation of the animal in a given visit, to detect distinct changes in direction caused by the trap. Finally, I compared behavioral scores between species and camera-specific factors like flash type. Lynx and wolves both apparently detected cameras (eyes and/or ears pointed directly at the camera) in approximately 11$\backslash${\%} of the visits, and altered their behavior in response to them. Two different categories of responses were discovered: Responses directly related to an apparent detection (approach, flight, observe and startle) and responses related to the presence camera traps (physical contact, olfactory sensing and squinting). I detected species-specific and camera-specific differences in behavioral impacts. Lynx were more likely to approach the camera, compare to wolves who expressed flight and startle response more pronounced. Flash and different flash types influenced the species differently in how they responded to the presence of camera traps. Both species were found to have pronounced change in orientation when expressing apparent detection responses to camera. My study revealed clear evidence of camera traps being low-invasive, but not non-invasive wildlife monitoring tools. This suggests that camera trap studies should quantify their impact on study species and its effect on inferences.},

More recently, high school educators have used nanotechnology to ignite student interest in science. Nanotechnology is now discussed with younger children in both formal and informal settings. In addition to fueling an interest in science and science careers, nanoscience concepts can be used to increase critical thinking skills, reasoning capability and more broadly nanoscience can be used enhance STEM education at all levels. A series of nanotechnology based hands on activities that have been used by over 21,000 students is being modified to address STEM aspects. The methodology for the modifications is to use adaptable flow charts that allow educators to select the path for the activity and the depth of content to be covered. Focus groups and surveys will determine the usefulness and effectiveness of this approach and provide information for improvement.},

@article{DeAngelis2017,
abstract = {The use of spatially explicit models (SEMs) in ecology has grown enormously in the past two decades. One major advancement has been that fine-scale details of landscapes, and of spatially dependent biological processes, such as dispersal and invasion, can now be simulated with great precision, due to improvements in computer technology. Many areas of modeling have shifted toward a focus on capturing these fine-scale details, to improve mechanistic understanding of ecosystems. However, spatially implicit models (SIMs) have played a dominant role in ecology, and arguments have been made that SIMs, which account for the effects of space without specifying spatial positions, have an advantage of being simpler and more broadly applicable, perhaps contributing more to understanding. We address this debate by comparing SEMs and SIMs in examples from the past few decades of modeling research. We argue that, although SIMs have been the dominant approach in the incorporation of space in theoretical ecology, SEMs have unique advantages for addressing pragmatic questions concerning species populations or communities in specific places, because local conditions, such as spatial heterogeneities, organism behaviors, and other contingencies, produce dynamics and patterns that usually cannot be incorporated into simpler SIMs. SEMs are also able to describe mechanisms at the local scale that can create amplifying positive feedbacks at that scale, creating emergent patterns at larger scales, and therefore are important to basic ecological theory. We review the use of SEMs at the level of populations, interacting populations, food webs, and ecosystems and argue that SEMs are not only essential in pragmatic issues, but must play a role in the understanding of causal relationships on landscapes.},

@article{Lopez-Bao2019,
abstract = {Despite extensive research on the ecology and behavioural adaptations of large carnivores in human-dominated landscapes, information about the fitness consequences of sharing landscapes is still limited. We assessed the variation in three consecutive components of female fitness: the probability of reproduction, litter size and juvenile survival in relation to environmental and human factors in a solitary carnivore, the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), occurring in human-dominated landscapes in Scandinavia. We used demographic data from 57 radio-collared adult females between 1995–2011 (126 radio-years). Overall, the yearly probability of female reproduction was 0.80, mean litter size was 2.34 (range 1–4) and the probability to find a female that reproduced in the spring being accompanied by at least one offspring during the subsequent winter was 0.70. We did not find evidence that food availability was a key factor influencing female fitness. Female lynx may adapt to food availability when establishing their home ranges by adopting an obstinate strategy, ensuring a minimum amount of prey necessary for survival and reproduction even during periods of prey scarcity. In human-dominated landscapes, where sufficient prey are available for lynx, mortality risk may have a larger influence on lynx population dynamics compared to food availability. Our results suggest that lynx population dynamics in human-dominated landscapes may be mainly driven by human impacts on survival.},

abstract = {Regression models such as the Cox proportional hazards model have had increasing use in modelling and estimating the prognosis of patients with a variety of diseases. Many applications involve a large number of variables to be modelled using a relatively small patient sample. Problems of overfitting and of identifying important covariates are exacerbated in analysing prognosis because the accuracy of a model is more a function of the number of events than of the sample size. We used a general index of predictive discrimination to measure the ability of a model developed on training samples of varying sizes to predict survival in an independent test sample of patients suspected of having coronary artery disease. We compared three methods of model fitting: (1) standard ‘step‐up' variable selection, (2) incomplete principal components regression, and (3) Cox model regression after developing clinical indices from variable clusters. We found regression using principal components to offer superior predictions in the test sample, whereas regression using indices offers easily interpretable models nearly as good as the principal components models. Standard variable selection has a number of deficiencies. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1984 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {ote cameras are an increasingly important tool in management and wildlife studies. However, we often do not know if they provide an unbiased sample of populations. Using a marked, radiocollared population of coyotes (Canis latrans) of known social status, we evaluated the influence of temporal (daily and seasonal) and spatial (distance between units, habitat, and proximity to human structures) factors on vulnerability to photo-captures. During 8 unbaited camera sessions of 6 weeks each, we obtained 158 coyote photographs at a photo-capture success rate of 1.6{\%}. We were able to identify not only marked individuals, but also a number of uncollared adults through variation in their pelage. Photo-capture of adults peaked 2 weeks after we established camera stations. Annual success for photographing adult coyotes was greatest during March and April, which corresponded with the dispersal season. The majority of photo-captures occurred at night, and adult photo-captures peaked around midnight, with smaller peaks at dawn and dusk. Rather than reflecting a circadian activity pattern, nighttime captures seemed to reflect when adult coyotes were most vulnerable to photo-capture. Characteristics of camera locations, such as amount of human activity, being on roads versus trails, and habitat type, also influenced the number ofphoto-captures. We conclude that remote cameras do not always provide an unbiased sample of populations and that animal behavior is important to consider when using these systems. Researchers using camera techniques need to carefully consider when, where, and how cameras are placed to reduce this bias.},

abstract = {Harvesting large carnivores can be a management tool for meeting politically set goals for their desired abundance. However, harvesting carnivores creates its own set of conflicts in both society and among conservation professionals, where one consequence is a need to demonstrate that management is sustainable, evidence-based, and guided by science. Furthermore, because large carnivores often also have high degrees of legal protection, harvest quotas have to be carefully justified and constantly adjusted to avoid damaging their conservation status. We developed a Bayesian state-space model to support adaptive management of Eurasian lynx harvesting in Scandinavia. The model uses data from the annual monitoring of lynx abundance and results from long-term field research on lynx biology, which has provided detailed estimates of key demographic parameters. We used the model to predict the probability that the forecasted population size will be below or above the management objectives when subjected to different harvest quotas. The model presented here informs decision makers about the policy risks of alternative harvest levels. Earlier versions of the model have been available for wildlife managers in both Sweden and Norway to guide lynx harvest quotas and the model predictions showed good agreement with observations. We combined monitoring data with data on vital rates and were able to estimate unobserved additional mortality rates, which are most probably due to poaching. In both countries, the past quota setting strategy suggests that there has been a de facto threshold strategy with increasing proportion, which means that there is no harvest below a certain population size, but above this threshold there is an increasing proportion of the population harvested as the population size increases. The annual assessment of the monitoring results, the use of forecasting models, and a threshold harvest approach to quota setting will all reduce the risk of lynx population sizes moving outside the desired goals. The approach we illustrate could be adapted to other populations of mammals worldwide.},

abstract = {Populations of large carnivores are declining at a rapid rate, primarily resulting from land use change due to increasing human pressure. Such changes can restrict available habitat for many species, particularly wide-ranging large carnivores. In Botswana, aside from protected areas, large tracts of land are set aside as wildlife management areas (WMAs). Wildlife management areas are important regions of habitat for many species and can serve as buffer zones between protected areas and agro-pastoral land, while allowing communities to utilise resources. It was hypothesised that land use type surrounding WMAs, human settlements and prey availability might affect carnivore distribution patterns. We conducted a camera-trap study with 96 stations in two WMAs in the Ghanzi district and used a Royles-Nichol multi-species occupancy model to test which factors influenced habitat use for nine carnivore species. Detection probability was low across all species, whereas occupancy varied substantially. Lion occurrence was highest close to protected areas, whereas leopards and brown hyaena occurred closer to commercial farms. Black-backed jackal and caracal had high occurrence probabilities near both protected and commercial farming areas. Settlement locations and wild prey availability did not strongly influence occurrence of any species, although black-backed jackals had higher occurrence in areas with high livestock frequency. As pressure for land continues to increase, available habitat for wildlife is reduced and wide-ranging species like carnivores are vulnerable to edge effects. The WMAs provide vital habitat for carnivores and can be used to improve livelihoods for communities, whilst maintaining biodiversity in the Kalahari.},

abstract = {Camera trapping is a widely applied method to study mammalian biodiversity and is still gaining popularity. It can quickly generate large amounts of data which need to be managed in an efficient and transparent way that links data acquisition with analytical tools. We describe the free and open-source R package camtrapR, a new toolbox for flexible and efficient management of data generated in camera trap-based wildlife studies. The package implements a complete workflow for processing camera trapping data. It assists in image organization, species and individual identification, data extraction from images, tabulation and visualization of results and export of data for subsequent analyses. There is no limitation to the number of images stored in this data management system; the system is portable and compatible across operating systems. The functions provide extensive automation to minimize data entry mistakes and, apart from species and individual identification, require minimal manual user input. Species and individual identification are performed outside the R environment, either via tags assigned in dedicated image management software or by moving images into species directories. Input for occupancy and (spatial) capture–recapture analyses for density and abundance estimation, for example in the R packages unmarked or secr, is computed in a flexible and reproducible manner. In addition, survey summary reports can be generated, spatial distributions of records can be plotted and exported to gis software, and single- and two-species activity patterns can be visualized. camtrapR allows for streamlined and flexible camera trap data management and should be most useful to researchers and practitioners who regularly handle large amounts of camera trapping data.},

abstract = {Reliable estimates of animal density and abundance are essential for effective wildlife conservation and management. Camera trapping has proven efficient for sampling multiple species, but statistical estimators of density from camera trapping data for species that cannot be individually identified are still in development. We extend point-transect methods for estimating animal density to accommodate data from camera traps, allowing researchers to exploit existing distance sampling theory and software for designing studies and analysing data. We tested it by simulation, and used it to estimate densities of Maxwell's duikers (Philantomba maxwellii) in Ta{\"{i}} National Park, C{\^{o}}te d'Ivoire. Densities estimated from simulated data were unbiased when we assumed animals were not available for detection during long periods of rest. Estimated duiker densities were higher than recent estimates from line transect surveys, which are believed to underestimate densities of forest ungulates. We expect these methods to provide an effective means to estimate animal density from camera trapping data and to be applicable in a variety of settings.},

@article{Gaston1999,
abstract = {1. Estimates of density are not always independent of the area over which populations are censused. Instead, lower densities tend to be recorded for species when they are censused over larger areas. This may have serious implications for both intra- and interspecific comparisons of density, with relevance to such issues as conservation prioritization and management strategies, because differences in density may simply result from differences in census areas. 2. Here, we use long-term population census data for British birds in the period 196891, drawn from the Common Birds Census (CBC), to examine relationships between density and census area within species, and the consequences of these relationships for intraspecific and interspecific density comparisons. 3. Most British bird species exhibit statistically significant negative relationships between density and census area. We used these relationships to standardize mean density estimates for all species to a common census area. These area-adjusted estimates were usually very similar to geometric mean density estimates calculated without reference to census area. 4. For a subset of species recorded from a large number ({\textgreater} 30) of census sites in each year in the period 1968-91, we used intraspecific density-area relationships for each year to standardize mean density estimates to a common census area in all years. Again, the area-adjusted estimates for each year were usually very similar to the simple geometric mean density estimates calculated for the species in the same year. 5. These results are encouraging, but are certainly a consequence of the relatively limited range of census areas used here, and the fact that the mean census area varies little across species, or across years within species. Moreover, those species occupying few sites are the most likely to have area-biased densities, but are the species for which area-correction will be most difficult. 6. Overall, the results suggest that past analyses conducted using the CBC data are unlikely to have been seriously confounded by variation in census area. Nevertheless, they do highlight that the effects of census area will require consideration by anyone planning to measure or use densities for comparative purposes either within or among species.},

abstract = {1.Abundance estimation is a pervasive goal in ecology. The rate of detection by motion-sensitive camera traps can, in principle, provide information on the abundance of many species of terrestrial vertebrates that are otherwise difficult to survey. The random encounter model (REM, Rowcliffe 2008) provides a means estimating abundance from camera trap rate but requires camera sensitivity to be quantified. 2.Here, we develop a method to estimate the area effectively monitored by cameras, which is one of the most important codeterminants of detection rate. Our method borrows from distance sampling theory, applying detection function models to data on the position (distance and angle relative to the camera) where the animals are first detected. Testing the reliability of this approach through simulation, we find that bias depends on the effective detection angle assumed but was generally low at less than 5{\%} for realistic angles typical of camera traps. 3.We adapted standard detection functions to allow for the possibility of smaller animals passing beneath the field of view close to the camera, resulting in reduced detection probability within that zone. Using a further simulation to test this approach, we find that detection distance can be estimated with little or no bias if detection probability is certain for at least some distance from the camera. 4.Applying this method to a 1-year camera trapping data set from Barro Colorado Island, Panama, we show that effective detection distance is related strongly positively to species body mass and weakly negatively to species average speed of movement. There was also a strong seasonal effect, with shorter detection distance during the wet season. Effective detection angle is related more weakly to species body mass, and again strongly to season, with a wider angle in the wet season. 5.This method represents an important step towards practical application of the REM, including abundance estimation for relatively small ({\textless}1kg) species. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {The lynx population in Scandinavia has been monitored since the 1990's using snow-tracking to detect the presence of family groups. Parts of Norway have experienced winters with limited snow cover in recent years, creating a need to find alternatives to our current monitoring meth- ods. This report summarize experiences from a pilot project testing camera traps for monitoring lynx in 3 study areas in southeastern Norway. The goal has been to test if camera traps increase the number of observations of family groups, and if we can use individual recognition from im- ages to calculate the density of lynx using spatial capture-recapture methods. Although camera traps are a standard method for lynx monitoring in many countries, there is a need to evaluate their suitability in Norway where we need to monitor very large areas with very low density lynx populations. Camera traps were deployed at 297 localities in the 3 study areas, in parts of Oslo, Akershus and {\O}stfold Counties (Region 4, 2010-2015), Vestfold County with adjoining areas of Buskerud and Telemark (Region 2, 2012-2015) and Oppland County (Region 3, 2014-2015). All fieldwork was conducted in collaboration with the Norwegian Hunters and Anglers Association in Oppland and Akershus, with assistance from students and volunteers. We photographed lynx 573 times in 112 locations during 120 453 camera-days. During the same period, we observed other species 42 435 times. In all three areas cameras increased the num- ber of observations of family groups. Fourteen of 18 family groups detected by the public and reported to the National Large Predator Monitoring Program (Rovdata) within the study areas during all study winters had at least one observation from camera-traps. We compared estimates of the number of family groups made by the traditional methods (lynx tracks in snow and grouping by distance criteria, AK) within the study areas with estimates based on data from camera traps. Estimates based on AK were 23 family groups for all years and all areas combined, and corre- sponding estimates solely based on data from camera traps were for 20 family groups. We estimated densities of lynx in Regions 4 and 2 using spatial capture-recapture methods, and in both areas lynx densities decreased during the study period. In Region 2 densities decreased from 2.1 (±0.7) lynx/1000 km2 in 2012/13 to 1.2 (±0.4) in 2014/15. In Region 4 lynx densities decreased from 2.0 (±0.5) and 2.9 (±1.5) lynx/1000 km2 the first 2 years to 1.3 (±0.4), 0.6 (±0.1) and 0.4 (±0.2) lynx/1000 km2 the last 3 winters. We followed nine lynx with GPS collars within these study areas, and all marked lynx were cap- tured by camera traps. Female lynx were photographed on average 10 times per year, while male lynx on average were photographed 27 times per year. We demonstrate that camera traps can be a useful supplement to the current snow-based mon- itoring of lynx family groups in Scandinavia. A more intensive system of camera traps may also provide estimates of lynx densities with a measure of the precision in the estimates. Our experi- ence here is also that the involvement of local people in the operation of the camera traps may reduce conflicts. We need to further develop camera traps as a method to be used in long-term studies of demographic parameters of lynx, behavioral studies, habitat selection, effects of hu- man disturbance and interactions with other species. It is also important to evaluate the potential of camera traps as a tool to monitor multiple species in forest ecosystems. John},

abstract = {Obtaining reliable species observations is of great importance in animal ecology and wildlife conservation. An increasing number of studies use camera traps (CTs) to study wildlife communities, and an increasing effort is made to make better use and reuse of the large amounts of data that are produced. It is in these circumstances that it becomes paramount to correct for the species- and study-specific variation in imperfect detection within CTs. We reviewed the literature and used our own experience to compile a list of factors that affect CT detection of animals. We did this within a conceptual framework of six distinct scales separating out the influences of (a) animal characteristics, (b) CT specifications, (c) CT set-up protocols, and (d) environmental variables. We identified 40 factors that can potentially influence the detection of animals by CTs at these six scales. Many of these factors were related to only a few overarching parameters. Most of the animal characteristics scale with body mass and diet type, and most environmental characteristics differ with season or latitude such that remote sensing products like NDVI could be used as a proxy index to capture this variation. Factors that influence detection at the microsite and camera scales are probably the most important in determining CT detection of animals. The type of study and specific research question will determine which factors should be corrected. Corrections can be done by directly adjusting the CT metric of interest or by using covariates in a statistical framework. Our conceptual framework can be used to design better CT studies and help when analyzing CT data. Furthermore, it provides an overview of which factors should be reported in CT studies to make them repeatable, comparable, and their data reusable. This should greatly improve the possibilities for global scale analyses of (reused) CT data.},

abstract = {Efficient and reliable methods for estimating animal density are essential to wildlife conservation and management. Camera trapping is an increasingly popular tool in this area of wildlife research, with further potential arising from technological improvements, such as video-recording functions that allow for behavioural observation of animals. This information may be useful in the estimation of animal density, even without individual recognition. Although several models applicable to species lacking individual markings (i.e. unmarked populations) have been developed, a methodology incorporating behavioural information from videos has not yet been established. We developed a likelihood-based model: the random encounter and staying time (REST) model. It is an extension of the random encounter model by Rowcliffe et al. (J Appl Ecol 45:1228, 2008). The REST model describes the relationship among staying time, trapping rate, and density, which is estimable using a frequentist or Bayesian approach. We tested the reliability and feasibility of the REST model using Monte Carlo simulations. We also applied the approach in the African rainforest and compared the results with those of a line-transect survey. The simulations showed that the REST model provided unbiased estimates of animal density. Even when animal movement speeds varied among individuals, and when animals travelled in pairs, the model provided unbiased density estimates. However, the REST model was vulnerable to unsynchronized activity patterns among individuals. Moreover, it is necessary to use a camera model with a fast and reliable infrared sensor and to set the camera trap's parameters appropriately (i.e. video length, delay period). The field survey showed that the staying time of two ungulate species in the African rainforest exhibited good fit with a temporal parametric distribution, and the REST model provided density estimates consistent with those of a line-transect survey. Synthesis and applications. The random encounter and staying time model provides better efficiency and higher feasibility than the random encounter model in estimating animal density without individual recognition. Careful application of the random encounter and staying time model provides the potential to estimate density of many ground-dwelling vertebrates lacking individually recognizable markings, and thus should be an effective method for population monitoring.},

The use of camera traps to estimate animal density has so far been restricted to capture-recapture analysis of species with individually identifiable markings. This study developed a method that eliminates the requirement for individual recognition of animals by modelling the underlying process of contact between animals and cameras. 2. The model provides a factor that linearly scales trapping rate with density, depending on two key biological variables (average animal group size and day range) and two characteristics of the camera sensor (distance and angle within which it detects animals). 3. We tested the approach in an enclosed animal park with known abundances of four species, obtaining accurate estimates in three out of four cases. Inaccuracy in the fourth species was because of biased placement of cameras with respect to the distribution of this species. 4. Synthesis and applications. Subject to unbiased camera placement and accurate measurement of model parameters, this method opens the possibility of reduced labour costs for estimating wildlife density and may make estimation possible where it has not been previously. We provide guidelines on the trapping effort required to obtain reasonably precise estimates. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {Annual and seasonal home ranges were calculated for 47 Eurasian lynx in four Scandinavian study sites (two in Sweden and two in Norway). The observed home ranges were the largest reported for the species, with study site averages ranging from 600 to 1400 km2 for resident males and from 300 to 800 km2 for resident females. When home range sizes were compared to the size of protected areas (national parks and nature reserves) in Scandinavia, it was concluded that very few protected areas contained sufficient forest to provide space for more than a few individuals. As a direct consequence of this, most lynx need to be conserved in the multiuse seminatural forest habitats that cover large areas in Scandinavia. This conservation strategy leads to a number of conflicts with some land uses (sheep and semidomestic reindeer herding, and roe deer hunters), but not all (forestry and moose harvest). Accordingly research must be aimed at understanding the ecology of these conflicts, and finding solutions.},

abstract = {The findings of medical research are often met with considerable scepticism, even when they have apparently come from studies with sound methodologies that have been subjected to appropriate statistical analysis. This is perhaps particularly the case with respect to epidemiological findings that suggest that some aspect of everyday life is bad for people. Indeed, one recent popular history, the medical journalist James Le Fanu's The Rise and Fall of Modern Medicine, went so far as to suggest that the solution to medicine's ills would be the closure of all departments of epidemiology.1One contributory factor is that the medical literature shows a strong tendency to accentuate the positive; positive outcomes are more likely to be reported than null results.2–4 By this means alone a host of purely chance findings will be published, as by conventional reasoning examining 20 associations will produce one result that is “significant at P = 0.05” by chance alone. If only positive findings are published then they may be mistakenly considered to be of importance rather than being the necessary chance results produced by the application of criteria for meaningfulness based on statistical significance. As many studies contain long questionnaires collecting information on hundreds of variables, and measure a wide range of potential outcomes, several false positive findings are virtually guaranteed. The high volume and often contradictory nature5 of medical research findings, however, is not only because of publication bias. A more fundamental problem is the widespread misunderstanding of the nature of statistical significance.},

abstract = {Camera trapping has become an increasingly widespread tool for wildlife ecologists, with large numbers of studies relying on photo capture rates or presence/absence information. It is increasingly clear that camera placement can directly impact this kind of data, yet these biases are poorly understood. We used a paired camera design to investigate the effect of small-scale habitat features on species richness estimates, and capture rate and detection probability of several mammal species in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, USA. Cameras were deployed at either log features or on game trails with a paired camera at a nearby random location. Overall capture rates were significantly higher at trail and log cameras compared to their paired random cameras, and some species showed capture rates as much as 9.7 times greater at feature-based cameras. We recorded more species at both log (17) and trail features (15) than at their paired control cameras (13 and 12 species, respectively), yet richness estimates were indistinguishable after 659 and 385 camera nights of survey effort, respectively. We detected significant increases (ranging from 11–33{\%}) in detection probability for five species resulting from the presence of game trails. For six species detection probability was also influenced by the presence of a log feature. This bias was most pronounced for the three rodents investigated, where in all cases detection probability was substantially higher (24.9–38.2{\%}) at log cameras. Our results indicate that small-scale factors, including the presence of game trails and other features, can have significant impacts on species detection when camera traps are employed. Significant biases may result if the presence and quality of these features are not documented and either incorporated into analytical procedures, or controlled for in study design.},

abstract = {An understanding of animal behaviour is important if conservation initiatives are to be effective. However, quantifying the behaviour of wild animals presents significant challenges. Remote-sensing camera traps are becoming increasingly popular survey instruments that have been used to non-invasively study a variety of animal behaviours, yielding key insights into behavioural repertoires. They are well suited to ethological studies and provide considerable opportunities for generating conservation-relevant behavioural data if novel and robust methodological and analytical solutions can be developed. This paper reviews the current state of camera-trap-based ethological studies, describes new and emerging directions in camera-based conservation behaviour, and highlights a number of limitations and considerations of particular relevance for camera-based studies. Three promising areas of study are discussed: (1) documenting anthropogenic impacts on behaviour; (2) incorporating behavioural responses into management planning and (3) using behavioural indicators such as giving up densities and daily activity patterns. We emphasize the importance of reporting methodological details, utilizing emerging camera trap metadata standards and central data repositories for facilitating reproducibility, comparison and synthesis across studies. Behavioural studies using camera traps are in their infancy; the full potential of the technology is as yet unrealized. Researchers are encouraged to embrace conservation-driven hypotheses in order to meet future challenges and improve the efficacy of conservation and management processes.},

abstract = {The availability of vertebrate hosts is a major determinant of the occurrence of ticks and tick-borne zoonoses in natural and anthropogenic ecosystems and thus drives disease risk for wildlife, livestock, and humans. However, it remains challenging to quantify the availability of vertebrate hosts in field settings, particularly for medium-sized to large-bodied mammals. Here, we present a method that uses camera traps to quantify the availability of warm-bodied vertebrates to ticks. The approach is to deploy camera traps at questing height at a representative sample of random points across the study area, measure the average photographic capture rate for vertebrate species, and then correct these rates for the effective detection distance. The resulting "passage rate" is a standardized measure of the frequency at which vertebrates approach questing ticks, which we show is proportional to contact rate. A field test across twenty 1-ha forest plots in the Netherlands indicated that this method effectively captures differences in wildlife assemblage composition between sites. Also, the relative abundances of three life stages of the sheep tick Ixodes ricinus from drag sampling were correlated with passage rates of deer, which agrees with the known association with this group of host species, suggesting that passage rate effectively reflects the availability of medium- to large-sized hosts to ticks. This method will facilitate quantitative studies of the relationship between densities of questing ticks and the availability of different vertebrate species-wild as well as domesticated species-in natural and anthropogenic settings.},

Camera Trapping brings together papers from a selection of the presentations at the colloquium and provides a benchmark of the international developments and uses of camera traps for monitoring wildlife for research and management. Four major themes are presented: case studies demonstrating camera trapping for monitoring; the constraints and pitfalls of camera technologies; design standards and protocols for camera trapping surveys; and the identification, management and analyses of the myriad images that derive from camera trapping studies. The final chapter provides future directions for research using camera traps. Remarkable photographs are included, showing interesting, enlightening and entertaining images of animals 'doing their thing'.},

abstract = {Camera traps deployed in grids or stratified random designs are a well-established survey tool for wildlife but there has been little evaluation of study design parameters. We used an empirical subsampling approach involving 2,225 camera deployments run at 41 study areas around the world to evaluate three aspects of camera trap study design (number of sites, duration and season of sampling) and their influence on the estimation of three ecological metrics (species richness, occupancy and detection rate) for mammals. We found that 25–35 camera sites were needed for precise estimates of species richness, depending on scale of the study. The precision of species-level estimates of occupancy ($\psi$) was highly sensitive to occupancy level, with {\textless}20 camera sites needed for precise estimates of common ($\psi$ {\textgreater} 0.75) species, but more than 150 camera sites likely needed for rare ($\psi$ {\textless} 0.25) species. Species detection rates were more difficult to estimate precisely at the grid level due to spatial heterogeneity, presumably driven by unaccounted habitat variability factors within the study area. Running a camera at a site for 2 weeks was most efficient for detecting new species, but 3–4 weeks were needed for precise estimates of local detection rate, with no gains in precision observed after 1 month. Metrics for all mammal communities were sensitive to seasonality, with 37{\%}–50{\%} of the species at the sites we examined fluctuating significantly in their occupancy or detection rates over the year. This effect was more pronounced in temperate sites, where seasonally sensitive species varied in relative abundance by an average factor of 4–5, and some species were completely absent in one season due to hibernation or migration. We recommend the following guidelines to efficiently obtain precise estimates of species richness, occupancy and detection rates with camera trap arrays: run each camera for 3–5 weeks across 40–60 sites per array. We recommend comparisons of detection rates be model based and include local covariates to help account for small-scale variation. Furthermore, comparisons across study areas or times must account for seasonality, which could have strong impacts on mammal communities in both tropical and temperate sites.},

abstract = {Abundance and density estimates are central to the field of ecology and are an important component of wildlife management. While many methods exist to estimate abundance from individually identifiable animals, it is much more difficult to estimate abundance of unmarked animals. One step toward noninvasive abundance estimation is the use of passive detectors such as remote cameras or acoustic recording devices. However, existing methods for estimating abundance from cameras for unmarked animals are limited by variable detection probability and have not taken full advantage of the information in camera trapping rate. We developed a time to event (TTE) model to estimate abundance from trapping rate. This estimate requires independent estimates of animal movement, so we collapsed the sampling occasions to create a space to event (STE) model that is not sensitive to movement rate. We further simplified the STE model into an instantaneous sampling (IS) estimator that applies fixed-area counts to cameras. The STE and IS models utilize time-lapse photographs to eliminate the variability in detection probability that comes with motion-sensor photographs. We evaluated the three methods with simulations and performed a case study to estimate elk (Cervus canadensis) abundance from remote camera trap data in Idaho. Simulations demonstrated that the TTE model is sensitive to movement rate, but the STE and IS methods are unbiased regardless of movement. In our case study, elk abundance estimates were comparable to those from a recent aerial survey in the area, demonstrating that these new methods allow biologists to estimate abundance from unmarked populations without tracking individuals over time.},

However, resolution of conflicts over wildlife management issues requires more than sophisticated human dimensiions techniques. Reliable knowledge is the foundation supporting wildlife management decisions; a lack of reliable knowledge provides a blank check to support lawyers. I duscuss examples of situtations in which wildlife professionals demonstrate a lack of rigor in gaining reliable knowledge, including refraining from opportunities to collect knowledge and not adequately monitoring the impacts of management decisions. I also address the improper use of population viability analysis and the adaptive management paradigm. So how does calculus relate? Calculus and other quantative courses train students to conceptualize problems and to think logically about solutions. Courses in experimental design and smapling provide the concepts of cause and effect and a valid sample of the population to which inferences apply. The past record ot hte wildlife profession does not speak well of our ability to demonstrate rigor in our management, as evidenced by the increasing rate at which management decsions are being made by courts and ballot initiatives. A capacity for rigorous thinking is derived through mental exercises, and a foundation of quantative courses provides this development.},

abstract = {Camera traps have become an important tool in wildlife monitoring. However, an issue in interpreting their data in statistical analyses of population densities, demography or behaviour is that the probability of detecting the target animals and their behaviours may vary depending on environmental and methodological factors. A specific problem is the type of flash used in the camera trap, as animals may react differently to different flash types and change their avoidance or habituation behaviour accordingly over time. Here, we provide the first systematic test of the impact of flash type in studies of red deer (Cervus elaphus) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), based on an analysis of behavioural responses to white, standard infrared and black flashes during 900 camera trap deployments in the Bavarian Forest National Park and the Northern Black Forest. The results revealed that both deer species were more likely to react to standard infrared than to black flash, but trigger delays prevented comparisons to white flash. Red deer reacted more frequently to camera traps than did roe deer, and responses were more common in the Northern Black Forest than in the Bavarian Forest National Park, where hunting is severely restricted. Contrary to our expectations, camera trapping rates of free-ranging deer did not significantly decline over time for any flash type or species. Despite the lack of evidence for avoidance behaviour, we recommend the use of black flash for behavioural studies of deer populations to minimize the risk of introducing a source of disturbance whereas infrared and white flash are equally suitable for determinations of demographic parameters.},

While pros and cons are vigorously debated, there has been little to no modeling of how adopting these measures might affect what type of science is published. In this article, we develop a novel optimality model that, given current incentives to publish, predicts a researcher's most rational use of resources in terms of the number of studies to undertake, the statistical power to devote to each study, and the desirable prestudy odds to pursue. We then develop a methodology that allows one to estimate the reliability of published research by considering a distribution of preferred research strategies. Using this approach, we investigate the merits of adopting measures of “greater statistical stringency” with the goal of informing the ongoing debate.},

abstract = {Practical techniques are required to monitor invasive animals, which are often cryptic and occur at low density. Camera traps have potential for this purpose, but may have problems detecting and identifying small species. A further challenge is how to standardise the size of each camera's field of view so capture rates are comparable between different places and times. We investigated the optimal specifications for a low-cost camera trap for small mammals. The factors tested were 1) trigger speed, 2) passive infrared vs. microwave sensor, 3) white vs. infrared flash, and 4) still photographs vs. video. We also tested a new approach to standardise each camera's field of view. We compared the success rates of four camera trap designs in detecting and taking recognisable photographs of captive stoats (Mustela erminea), feral cats (Felis catus) and hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus). Trigger speeds of 0.2-2.1 s captured photographs of all three target species unless the animal was running at high speed. The camera with a microwave sensor was prone to false triggers, and often failed to trigger when an animal moved in front of it. A white flash produced photographs that were more readily identified to species than those obtained under infrared light. However, a white flash may be more likely to frighten target animals, potentially affecting detection probabilities. Video footage achieved similar success rates to still cameras but required more processing time and computer memory. Placing two camera traps side by side achieved a higher success rate than using a single camera. Camera traps show considerable promise for monitoring invasive mammal control operations. Further research should address how best to standardise the size of each camera's field of view, maximise the probability that an animal encountering a camera trap will be detected, and eliminate visible or audible cues emitted by camera traps. {\textcopyright} 2013 Glen et al.},

abstract = {Camera trapping, paired with analytical methods for estimating species occurrence, population size or density, can yield information with direct consequences for wildlife management and conservation. Detectability, the ability to detect a species or individual if it is present, affects the reliability and efficiency of camera trap surveys and, in turn, varies across species, space and time. Greater detectability means greater sample size, and a common approach to boost detectability of wildlife by camera traps involves the application of olfactory lures. Using a camera trap study on sympatric mesocarnivores (European badger Meles meles, red fox Vulpes vulpes, pine marten Martes martes and domestic cat Felis catus), we quantified three elements of detectability: (1) the time until first detection (‘sooner', conditional on being present), (2) the proximity to a focal point in front of the camera (‘closer', conditional on being detected) and (3) the duration of exposure to the camera (‘longer', conditional on being detected). A hierarchical analytical approach and a quasi-experimental setup allowed us to test for and quantify the species-specific effect of olfactory lures on these aspects of detectability. Depending on species, average median time to first detection ranged from 4 to 28 days, distance to the focal point from 0.3 to 0.8 body lengths, and median time to departure from 2 to 6 seconds. Credible intervals overlapped substantially between most species in all three measures, and variation between observations was extensive. We detected effects of lures on time to first detection for cats (castoreum; American beaver Castor canadensis scent), distance to focal point for badgers (striped skunk Mephitis mephitis scent) and martens (castoreum, fox and skunk scents), and the duration of exposure for foxes (fox and skunk scents). We discuss how a multifaceted perspective on detectability in camera trap studies, linked with species biology, can give investigators a more structured approach to selecting and testing measures intended to boost detection probability.},

@article{Teurlings2020,
abstract = {Large solitary felids often kill large prey items that can provide multiple meals. However, being able to utilize these multiple meals requires that they can cache the meat in a manner that delays its discovery by vertebrate and invertebrate scavengers. Covering the kill with vegetation and snow is a commonly observed strategy among felids. This study investigates the utility of this strategy using observational data from Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx)-killed roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) carcasses, and a set of two experiments focused on vertebrate and invertebrate scavengers, respectively. Lynx-killed roe deer that were covered by snow or vegetation were less likely to have been visited by scavengers. Experimentally-deployed video-monitored roe deer carcasses had significantly longer time prior to discovery by avian scavengers when covered with vegetation. Carcass parts placed in cages that excluded vertebrate scavengers had delayed invertebrate activity when covered with vegetation. All three datasets indicated that covering a kill was a successful caching/anti-scavenger strategy. These results can help explain why lynx functional responses reach plateaus at relatively low kill rates. The success of this anti-scavenging behavior therefore has clear effects on the dynamics of a predator–prey system.},

abstract = {We studied the influence of surveyed area size on density estimates by means of camera-trapping in a low-density felid population (1-2 individuals/100 km2). We applied non-spatial capture-recapture (CR) and spatial CR (SCR) models for Eurasian lynx during winter 2005/2006 in the northwestern Swiss Alps by sampling an area divided into 5 nested plots ranging from 65 to 760 km2. CR model density estimates (95{\%} CI) for models M0 and Mh decreased from 2.61 (1.55-3.68) and 3.6 (1.62-5.57) independent lynx/100 km2, respectively, in the smallest to 1.20 (1.04-1.35) and 1.26 (0.89-1.63) independent lynx/100 km2, respectively, in the largest area surveyed. SCR model density estimates also decreased with increasing sampling area but not significantly. High individual range overlaps in relatively small areas (the edge effect) is the most plausible reason for this positive bias in the CR models. Our results confirm that SCR models are much more robust to changes in trap array size than CR models, thus avoiding overestimation of density in smaller areas. However, when a study is concerned with monitoring population changes, large spatial efforts (area surveyed ≥760 km2) are required to obtain reliable and precise density estimates with these population densities and recapture rates. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd, ISZS and IOZ/CAS.},

abstract = {Camera trapping is widely used in ecological studies. It is often considered nonintrusive simply because animals are not captured or handled. However, the emission of light and sound from camera traps can be intrusive. We evaluated the daytime and nighttime behavioral responses of four mammalian predators to camera traps in road-based, passive (no bait) surveys, in order to determine how this might affect ecological investigations. Wild dogs, European red foxes, feral cats, and spotted-tailed quolls all exhibited behaviors indicating they noticed camera traps. Their recognition of camera traps was more likely when animals were approaching the device than if they were walking away from it. Some individuals of each species retreated from camera traps and some moved toward them, with negative behaviors slightly more common during the daytime. There was no consistent response to camera traps within species; both attraction and repulsion were observed. Camera trapping is clearly an intrusive sampling method for some individuals of some species. This may limit the utility of conclusions about animal behavior obtained from camera trapping. Similarly, it is possible that behavioral responses to camera traps could affect detection probabilities, introducing as yet unmeasured biases into camera trapping abundance surveys. These effects demand consideration when utilizing camera traps in ecological research and will ideally prompt further work to quantify associated biases in detection probabilities.},

abstract = {Reliable assessment of animal populations is a long-standing challenge in wildlife ecology. Technological advances have led to widespread adoption of camera traps (CTs) to survey wildlife distribution, abundance and behaviour. As for any wildlife survey method, camera trapping must contend with sources of sampling error such as imperfect detection. Early applications focused on density estimation of naturally marked species, but there is growing interest in broad-scale CT surveys of unmarked populations and communities. Nevertheless, inferences based on detection indices are controversial, and the suitability of alternatives such as occupancy estimation is debatable. We reviewed 266 CT studies published between 2008 and 2013. We recorded study objectives and methodologies, evaluating the consistency of CT protocols and sampling designs, the extent to which CT surveys considered sampling error, and the linkages between analytical assumptions and species ecology. Nearly two-thirds of studies surveyed more than one species, and a majority used response variables that ignored imperfect detection (e.g. presence-absence, relative abundance). Many studies used opportunistic sampling and did not explicitly report details of sampling design and camera deployment that could affect conclusions. Most studies estimating density used capture-recapture methods on marked species, with spatially explicit methods becoming more prominent. Few studies estimated density for unmarked species, focusing instead on occupancy modelling or measures of relative abundance. While occupancy studies estimated detectability, most did not explicitly define key components of the modelling framework (e.g. a site) or discuss potential violations of model assumptions (e.g. site closure). Studies using relative abundance relied on assumptions of equal detectability, and most did not explicitly define expected relationships between measured responses and underlying ecological processes (e.g. animal abundance and movement). Synthesis and applications. The rapid adoption of camera traps represents an exciting transition in wildlife survey methodology. We remain optimistic about the technology's promise, but call for more explicit consideration of underlying processes of animal abundance, movement and detection by cameras, including more thorough reporting of methodological details and assumptions. Such transparency will facilitate efforts to evaluate and improve the reliability of camera trap surveys, ultimately leading to stronger inferences and helping to meet modern needs for effective ecological inquiry and biodiversity monitoring.
