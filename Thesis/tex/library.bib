abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The structure of the canine tapetum lucidum appears to be basically similar to that described in some other carnivores, but specific distinctions are present. The reflecting rodlets of the dog are similar in their dimensions to those of the cat, but they are more closely packed, resulting in a unique value for the wavelength of maximal reflectance. In addition, the rodlets are less precisely orientated, as compared to those of the cat, a condition which appears to result in a less efficient reflectance from the dog tapetum. It has also been shown that the dog does not possess a retinal tapetum lucidum, as had previously been suggested.},

abstract = {Scientists should be able to provide support for the absence of a meaningful effect. Currently, researchers often incorrectly conclude an effect is absent based a nonsignificant result. A widely recommended approach within a frequentist framework is to test for equivalence. In equivalence tests, such as the two one-sided tests (TOST) procedure discussed in this article, an upper and lower equivalence bound is specified based on the smallest effect size of interest. The TOST procedure can be used to statistically reject the presence of effects large enough to be considered worthwhile. This practical primer with accompanying spreadsheet and R package enables psychologists to easily perform equivalence tests (and power analyses) by setting equivalence bounds based on standardized effect sizes and provides recommendations to prespecify equivalence bounds. Extending your statistical tool kit with equivalence tests is an easy way to improve your statistical and theoretical inferences.},

abstract = {It is now commonly recognized that animals have different personalities and that these personalities are moderately heritable, repeatable, and may influence fitness components such as survival and reproduction. Much of this knowledge has been gained by studying birds, and in particular great tits Parus major. In nature, great variation in personalities seems to exist, from shy to bold individuals, i.e. a shy-bold continuum. It has been suggested that the various personalities have equal fitness over time because of environmental variation, and thus represent Evolutionary Stable Strategies (ESS). An alternative is that some individuals with low fighting ability, e.g. because of poor rearing conditions, play a shy personality ( Best of a bad job strategy). I wanted to address this problem by studying anti-predator behaviour in great tits and blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus in a woodland area in Norway. A total of 107 great tit and 75 blue tit local recruits (grown up in the area) were caught in the autumn and several measures of anti-predator behaviour were recorded. Subsequent winter survival and reproductive success (i.e. laying date, clutch size, number of fledged and body mass on day 15) were observed. As the methods adopted in this study to measure personality traits were previously little used, analyses of repeatability was performed in order to determine whether the methods proved to be a reliable way of measuring personality. The results showed quite high repeatability within observers, but low repeatability between observers and within and between anti-predator variables in general. Possible explanations for this are discussed. Two significant relationships, both for great tits, were obtained between fitness measures and anti-predator behaviour (survivors screamed less than non-survivors, and birds with low breathing rate laid more eggs than birds with high breathing rate). However, due to the large number of tests, and data from one year only, no firm conclusions could be drawn. Improved methods and data from more years are needed.},

abstract = {Harvesting large carnivores can be a management tool for meeting politically set goals for their desired abundance. However, harvesting carnivores creates its own set of conflicts in both society and among conservation professionals, where one consequence is a need to demonstrate that management is sustainable, evidence-based, and guided by science. Furthermore, because large carnivores often also have high degrees of legal protection, harvest quotas have to be carefully justified and constantly adjusted to avoid damaging their conservation status. We developed a Bayesian state-space model to support adaptive management of Eurasian lynx harvesting in Scandinavia. The model uses data from the annual monitoring of lynx abundance and results from long-term field research on lynx biology, which has provided detailed estimates of key demographic parameters. We used the model to predict the probability that the forecasted population size will be below or above the management objectives when subjected to different harvest quotas. The model presented here informs decision makers about the policy risks of alternative harvest levels. Earlier versions of the model have been available for wildlife managers in both Sweden and Norway to guide lynx harvest quotas and the model predictions showed good agreement with observations. We combined monitoring data with data on vital rates and were able to estimate unobserved additional mortality rates, which are most probably due to poaching. In both countries, the past quota setting strategy suggests that there has been a de facto threshold strategy with increasing proportion, which means that there is no harvest below a certain population size, but above this threshold there is an increasing proportion of the population harvested as the population size increases. The annual assessment of the monitoring results, the use of forecasting models, and a threshold harvest approach to quota setting will all reduce the risk of lynx population sizes moving outside the desired goals. The approach we illustrate could be adapted to other populations of mammals worldwide.},

abstract = {Large carnivores can either directly influence ungulate populations or indirectly affect their behaviour. Knowledge from European systems, in contrast to North American systems, on how this might lead to cascading effects on lower trophic levels is virtually absent. We studied whether wolves Canis lupus via density-mediated and behaviorally-mediated effects on their ungulate prey species influence patterns of browsing and tree regeneration inside the Bialowie{\.{z}}a National Park, Poland. Browsing intensity of tree saplings (height class {\textless} 150 cm), irrespective of tree species or forest type, was lower inside a wolf core area (50.5{\%}) where predator presence is highest, than in the remainder of the wolf pack's home range (58.3{\%}). Additionally, browsing intensity was reduced when the amount of coarse woody debris (CWD), which can act as a 'ungulate escape impediment', increased (within 5-m radius) inside the wolf core area. No relationship existed outside the core area. As a result, the proportion of trees growing out of herbivore control increased more strongly with increasing amount of CWD inside compared to outside the wolf core area. This suggests that next to direct effects of wolves on ungulate density caused by a higher predation pressure inside the core area, risk effects are important and are enhanced by habitat characteristics. These results indicate that behaviorally-mediated effects of predators on prey can become more important than density-mediated effects in affecting lower trophic levels. This is the first study we are aware of, that shows CWD can create fine-scale risk effects on ungulates with the potential for cascading effects of large predators on patterns of tree regeneration for a European forest system. This knowledge broadens the discussion on how the impact of large predators on ecosystem functioning depends on the physical landscape, by illustrating these effects for a system which largely contrasts in this respect to the North American systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {{\^{u}}Wildlife management is more than just biology, and practicing wildlife professionals are confronted often with teh human dimensions aspect of the profession. However, resolution of conflicts over wildlife management issues requires more than sophisticated human dimensiions techniques. Reliable knowledge is the foundation supporting wildlife management decisions; a lack of reliable knowledge provides a blank check to support lawyers. I duscuss examples of situtations in which wildlife professionals demonstrate a lack of rigor in gaining reliable knowledge, including refraining from opportunities to collect knowledge and not adequately monitoring the impacts of management decisions. I also address the improper use of population viability analysis and the adaptive management paradigm. So how does calculus relate? Calculus and other quantative courses train students to conceptualize problems and to think logically about solutions. Courses in experimental design and smapling provide the concepts of cause and effect and a valid sample of the population to which inferences apply. The past record ot hte wildlife profession does not speak well of our ability to demonstrate rigor in our management, as evidenced by the increasing rate at which management decsions are being made by courts and ballot initiatives. A capacity for rigorous thinking is derived through mental exercises, and a foundation of quantative courses provides this development.},

abstract = {We show that the nuclear architecture of rod photoreceptor cells differs fundamentally in nocturnal and diurnal mammals. The rods of diurnal retinas possess the conventional architecture found in nearly all eukaryotic cells, with most heterochromatin situated at the nuclear periphery and euchromatin residing toward the nuclear interior. The rods of nocturnal retinas have a unique inverted pattern, where heterochromatin localizes in the nuclear center, whereas euchromatin, as well as nascent transcripts and splicing machinery, line the nuclear border. The inverted pattern forms by remodeling of the conventional one during terminal differentiation of rods. The inverted rod nuclei act as collecting lenses, and computer simulations indicate that columns of such nuclei channel light efficiently toward the light-sensing rod outer segments. Comparison of the two patterns suggests that the conventional architecture prevails in eukaryotic nuclei because it results in more flexible chromosome arrangements, facilitating positional regulation of nuclear functions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Most vertebrate groups exhibit eye shapes that vary predictably with activity pattern. Nocturnal vertebrates typically have large corneas relative to eye size as an adaptation for increased visual sensitivity. Conversely, diurnal vertebrates generally demonstrate smaller corneas relative to eye size as an adaptation for increased visual acuity. By contrast, several studies have concluded that many mammals exhibit typical nocturnal eye shapes, regardless of activity pattern. However, a recent study has argued that new statistical methods allow eye shape to accurately predict activity patterns of mammals, including cathemeral species (animals that are equally likely to be awake and active at any time of day or night). Here, we conduct a detailed analysis of eye shape and activity pattern in mammals, using a broad comparative sample of 266 species. We find that the eye shapes of cathemeral mammals completely overlap with nocturnal and diurnal species. Additionally, most diurnal and cathemeral mammals have eye shapes that are most similar to those of nocturnal birds and lizards. The only mammalian clade that diverges from this pattern is anthropoids, which have convergently evolved eye shapes similar to those of diurnal birds and lizards. Our results provide additional evidence for a nocturnal 'bottleneck' in the early evolution of crown mammals. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society.},

Most lynx birth dates were highly synchronised around a mean of 30th May (SD = 9 days) with 173 of the 175 births ranging from May 2nd to June 30th. We detected two very late births on July 29th and August 15th in the absence of any indication that the females had given birth and lost a litter earlier in the year. We propose that these represent evidence of a second oestrus which is highly unusual in lynx because of their unique reproductive physiology.

abstract = {The structure of the rod-cone network in the area centralis of cat retina was studied by reconstruction from serial electron micrographs. About 48 rods converge on each cone via gap junctions between the rod spherules and the basal processes of the cone pedicle. One rod diverges to 2.4 cones through these gap junctions, and each cone connects to 8 other cones, also through gap junctions. A static cable model of this network showed that at mesopic intensities, when all rods converging on a cone pedicle are continuously active, the collective rod signal would be efficiently conveyed to the pedicle. At scotopic intensities sufficiently low for only one of the converging rods to receive a single photon within its integration time, the quantal rod signal would be poorly transmitted to the cone pedicle. This is because the tiny signal would be dissipated by the large network into which the individual rod diverges. Under this condition, the rod signal would also be poorly conveyed to the rod spherule. If, however, the rods are electrically disconnected from the network, the quantal signal would be efficiently conveyed to the rod spherule. This analysis suggests that the rod signal is conveyed at mesopic intensities by the cone bipolar pathway and, at scotopic intensities, by the rod bipolar pathway, in accordance with the results of Nelson (1977, 1982; Nelson and Kolb, 1985).},

abstract = {ote cameras are an increasingly important tool in management and wildlife studies. However, we often do not know if they provide an unbiased sample of populations. Using a marked, radiocollared population of coyotes (Canis latrans) of known social status, we evaluated the influence of temporal (daily and seasonal) and spatial (distance between units, habitat, and proximity to human structures) factors on vulnerability to photo-captures. During 8 unbaited camera sessions of 6 weeks each, we obtained 158 coyote photographs at a photo-capture success rate of 1.6{\%}. We were able to identify not only marked individuals, but also a number of uncollared adults through variation in their pelage. Photo-capture of adults peaked 2 weeks after we established camera stations. Annual success for photographing adult coyotes was greatest during March and April, which corresponded with the dispersal season. The majority of photo-captures occurred at night, and adult photo-captures peaked around midnight, with smaller peaks at dawn and dusk. Rather than reflecting a circadian activity pattern, nighttime captures seemed to reflect when adult coyotes were most vulnerable to photo-capture. Characteristics of camera locations, such as amount of human activity, being on roads versus trails, and habitat type, also influenced the number ofphoto-captures. We conclude that remote cameras do not always provide an unbiased sample of populations and that animal behavior is important to consider when using these systems. Researchers using camera techniques need to carefully consider when, where, and how cameras are placed to reduce this bias.},

abstract = {Reliable estimates of animal density and abundance are essential for effective wildlife conservation and management. Camera trapping has proven efficient for sampling multiple species, but statistical estimators of density from camera trapping data for species that cannot be individually identified are still in development. We extend point-transect methods for estimating animal density to accommodate data from camera traps, allowing researchers to exploit existing distance sampling theory and software for designing studies and analysing data. We tested it by simulation, and used it to estimate densities of Maxwell's duikers (Philantomba maxwellii) in Ta{\"{i}} National Park, C{\^{o}}te d'Ivoire. Densities estimated from simulated data were unbiased when we assumed animals were not available for detection during long periods of rest.

abstract = {Infrared (IR) irradiation is frequently used in ophthalmological diagnosis and treatment. It has been used to selectively stimulate photodiode-based retinal prostheses to prove their function. Data concerning the natural IR-sensitivity of the retina are contradictory. In our experiments in dark-adapted cats an IR-laser (826 nm) and IR emitting diodes (875 nm) elicited clear scotopic threshold responses. Comparison of the two lasers (IR and a visible laser at 670 nm) using Lambs template and our experimental data revealed very similar differences in retinal sensitivity (4.28 and 3.94 ± 0.29 log units, respectively). The fact that the cat retina is sensitive to IR-irradiation under certain conditions has important implications in interpreting the results from retinal prostheses and rewards further attention in its use in many ophthalmological applications. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Camera trapping, paired with analytical methods for estimating species occurrence, population size or density, can yield information with direct consequences for wildlife management and conservation. Detectability, the ability to detect a species or individual if it is present, affects the reliability and efficiency of camera trap surveys and, in turn, varies across species, space and time. Greater detectability means greater sample size, and a common approach to boost detectability of wildlife by camera traps involves the application of olfactory lures. Using a camera trap study on sympatric mesocarnivores (European badger Meles meles, red fox Vulpes vulpes, pine marten Martes martes and domestic cat Felis catus), we quantified three elements of detectability: (1) the time until first detection (‘sooner', conditional on being present), (2) the proximity to a focal point in front of the camera (‘closer', conditional on being detected) and (3) the duration of exposure to the camera (‘longer', conditional on being detected). A hierarchical analytical approach and a quasi-experimental setup allowed us to test for and quantify the species-specific effect of olfactory lures on these aspects of detectability. Depending on species, average median time to first detection ranged from 4 to 28 days, distance to the focal point from 0.3 to 0.8 body lengths, and median time to departure from 2 to 6 seconds. Credible intervals overlapped substantially between most species in all three measures, and variation between observations was extensive. We detected effects of lures on time to first detection for cats (castoreum; American beaver Castor canadensis scent), distance to focal point for badgers (striped skunk Mephitis mephitis scent) and martens (castoreum, fox and skunk scents), and the duration of exposure for foxes (fox and skunk scents). We discuss how a multifaceted perspective on detectability in camera trap studies, linked with species biology, can give investigators a more structured approach to selecting and testing measures intended to boost detection probability.},

Our molecular reconstruction of diel activity patterns, which is supported by morphological evidence, consistently showed that carnivorous mammals were subjected to a shift from diurnality to nocturnality, while herbivorous mammals experienced a shift from nocturnality to diurnality during their evolutionary histories. A shift in the diel activity of the herbivores as a result of carnivore avoidance is hypothesized based on molecular, morphological and behavioural evidence, and our results suggest an evolutionary-scale arms race of diel activity shifts between carnivorous and herbivorous mammals.},

This paper addresses recent developments in the study of both intra- and inter-individual variation. After reviewing several methods (e.g., intraclass correlation, product-moment correlation, and confirmatory factor analysis) for quantifying intra-individual consistency or repeatability, we discuss how these measures of repeatability can serve as guides for appropriately defining traits and how they may be helpful in ensuring that appropriate statistical models are used (e.g., in accounting for measurement errors in regression analyses). We discuss three aspects of inter-individual variation; phenotypic selection, alternative individual strategies and phenotypic integration, and quantitative genetic analyses. The value of these approaches for studying inter-individual variation is illustrated with recent examples from the literature. Finally, we discuss how many field studies of mammals may be well poised to exploit the unique insights that can be gained from studying individual variation.},

This neurotransmitter receptor has been shown previously to be present only in the synapses of the ON bipolar cell dendrites, and it mediates synaptic transmission from rod and cone photoreceptors to this type of second-order neuron. Despite the synaptic defect, best visual acuities were normal or only moderately reduced (20/15 to 20/40). The patients were night blind from an early age, and when maximally dark-adapted, they could perceive lights only with an intensity equal to or slightly dimmer than that normally detected by the cone system (i.e., 2-3 log units above normal). Electroretinograms (ERGs) in response to single brief flashes of light had clearly detectable a-waves, which are derived from photoreceptors, and greatly reduced b-waves, which are derived from the second-order inner retinal neurons. ERGs in response to sawtooth flickering light indicated a markedly reduced ON response and a nearly normal OFF response. There was no subjective delay in the perception of suddenly appearing white vs. black objects on a gray background. These patients exemplify a previously unrecognized, autosomal recessive form of congenital night blindness associated with a negative ERG waveform. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

Variation in personality within a population may be maintained by balancing selection if different values of personality traits are favoured under different conditions. We measured personality in 98 female North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus Erxleben), and examined whether its variation could be maintained by changing selection pressures acting via reproductive traits and yearly variation in food abundance. There was no effect of personality on parturition date or litter size, but a female's activity was correlated to the growth rate of her offspring in the nest, and her aggressiveness was correlated to their survival in the nest and overwinter. The magnitude and direction of the effects changed among life history stages and years, possibly in association with food supply in some cases, and may indicate a role for balancing selection in the maintenance of personality. {\textcopyright} 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Automatically triggered cameras taking photographs or videos of passing animals (camera traps) have emerged over the last decade as one of the most powerful tool for wildlife research. In parallel, a wealth of camera trap systems and models has become commercially available, a phenomenon mainly driven by the increased use of camera traps by sport hunters. This has raised the need for developing criteria to choose the suitable camera trap model in relation to a range of factors, primarily the study aim, but also target species, habitat, trapping site, climate and any other aspect that affects camera performance. There is also fragmented information on the fundamentals of sampling designs that deploy camera trapping, such as number of sampling sites, spatial arrangement and sampling duration. In this review, we describe the relevant technological features of camera traps and propose a set of the key ones to be evaluated when choosing camera models. These features are camera specifications such as trigger speed, sensor sensitivity, detection zone, flash type and flash intensity, power autonomy, and related specifications. We then outline sampling design and camera features for the implementation of major camera trapping applications, specifically: (1) faunal inventories, (2) occupancy studies, (3) density estimation through Capture-Mark-Recapture and (4) density estimation through the Random Encounter Model. We also review a range of currently available models and stress the need for standardized testing of camera models that should be frequently updated and widely distributed. Finally we summarize the ultimate camera trap, as desired by wildlife biologists, and the current technological limitations of camera traps in relation to their potential for a number of emerging applications.},

abstract = {Camera trapping is widely used in ecological studies. It is often considered nonintrusive simply because animals are not captured or handled. However, the emission of light and sound from camera traps can be intrusive. We evaluated the daytime and nighttime behavioral responses of four mammalian predators to camera traps in road-based, passive (no bait) surveys, in order to determine how this might affect ecological investigations. Wild dogs, European red foxes, feral cats, and spotted-tailed quolls all exhibited behaviors indicating they noticed camera traps. Their recognition of camera traps was more likely when animals were approaching the device than if they were walking away from it. Some individuals of each species retreated from camera traps and some moved toward them, with negative behaviors slightly more common during the daytime. There was no consistent response to camera traps within species; both attraction and repulsion were observed. Camera trapping is clearly an intrusive sampling method for some individuals of some species. This may limit the utility of conclusions about animal behavior obtained from camera trapping. Similarly, it is possible that behavioral responses to camera traps could affect detection probabilities, introducing as yet unmeasured biases into camera trapping abundance surveys. These effects demand consideration when utilizing camera traps in ecological research and will ideally prompt further work to quantify associated biases in detection probabilities.},

abstract = {In ecology, camera trapping is commonly used as a non-invasive technique to collect ecological observation data and to monitor populations. The technique is used to address a variety of research questions worldwide. Despite being widely used, few studies have evaluated the potential effects of camera traps on animals, and to my knowledge no studies have quantified to what extent and under which conditions such effects occur. In this thesis, I have assessed the behavior of two large carnivores in Norway, Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) and wolf (Canis lupus), using still images captured by camera traps. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the presence of camera traps can cause behavioral changes in wildlife. I recorded behaviors that indicated apparent detection of cameras by visual and/or acoustic contact. Furthermore, other distinct behaviors towards camera was assessed, in addition to the orientation of the animal in a given visit, to detect distinct changes in direction caused by the trap. Finally, I compared behavioral scores between species and camera-specific factors like flash type. Lynx and wolves both apparently detected cameras (eyes and/or ears pointed directly at the camera) in approximately 11$\backslash${\%} of the visits, and altered their behavior in response to them. Two different categories of responses were discovered: Responses directly related to an apparent detection (approach, flight, observe and startle) and responses related to the presence camera traps (physical contact, olfactory sensing and squinting). I detected species-specific and camera-specific differences in behavioral impacts. Lynx were more likely to approach the camera, compare to wolves who expressed flight and startle response more pronounced. Flash and different flash types influenced the species differently in how they responded to the presence of camera traps. Both species were found to have pronounced change in orientation when expressing apparent detection responses to camera. My study revealed clear evidence of camera traps being low-invasive, but not non-invasive wildlife monitoring tools. This suggests that camera trap studies should quantify their impact on study species and its effect on inferences.},

abstract = {The activity patterns exhibited by animals are shaped by evolution, but additionally fine-tuned by flexible responses to the environment. Predation risk and resource availability are environmental cues which influence the behavioural decisions that make both predators and prey engage in activity bursts, and depending on their local importance, can be strong enough to override the endogenous regulation of an animals' circadian clock. In Southern Europe, wherever the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is abundant, it is the main prey of most mammalian mesopredators, and rodents are generally the alternative prey. We evaluated the bidirectional relation between the diel activity strategies of these mammalian mesopredators and prey coexisting in south-western Europe. Results revealed that even though predation risk enforced by mammalian mesocarnivores during night-time was approximately twice and five times higher than during twilight and daytime, respectively, murids consistently displayed unimodal nocturnal behaviour. Conversely, the European rabbits exhibited a bimodal pattern that peaked around sunrise and sunset. Despite the existence of some overlap between the diel rhythms of mesocarnivores and rabbits, their patterns were not synchronized. We suggest that the environmental stressors in our study areas are not severe enough to override the endogenous regulation of the circadian cycle in murids. European rabbits, however, are able to suppress their biological tendency for nocturnality by selecting a predominantly crepuscular pattern. In spite of the higher energetic input, mesocarnivores do not completely track rabbits' activity pattern. They rather track rodents' activity. We propose that these systems have probably evolved towards a situation where some degree of activity during high-risk periods benefits the overall prey population survival, while the accessibility to sufficient prey prevents predators to completely track them. {\textcopyright} 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract = {Populations of large carnivores are declining at a rapid rate, primarily resulting from land use change due to increasing human pressure. Such changes can restrict available habitat for many species, particularly wide-ranging large carnivores. In Botswana, aside from protected areas, large tracts of land are set aside as wildlife management areas (WMAs). Wildlife management areas are important regions of habitat for many species and can serve as buffer zones between protected areas and agro-pastoral land, while allowing communities to utilise resources. It was hypothesised that land use type surrounding WMAs, human settlements and prey availability might affect carnivore distribution patterns. We conducted a camera-trap study with 96 stations in two WMAs in the Ghanzi district and used a Royles-Nichol multi-species occupancy model to test which factors influenced habitat use for nine carnivore species. Detection probability was low across all species, whereas occupancy varied substantially. Lion occurrence was highest close to protected areas, whereas leopards and brown hyaena occurred closer to commercial farms. Black-backed jackal and caracal had high occurrence probabilities near both protected and commercial farming areas. Settlement locations and wild prey availability did not strongly influence occurrence of any species, although black-backed jackals had higher occurrence in areas with high livestock frequency. As pressure for land continues to increase, available habitat for wildlife is reduced and wide-ranging species like carnivores are vulnerable to edge effects. The WMAs provide vital habitat for carnivores and can be used to improve livelihoods for communities, whilst maintaining biodiversity in the Kalahari.},

abstract = {Despite extensive research on the ecology and behavioural adaptations of large carnivores in human-dominated landscapes, information about the fitness consequences of sharing landscapes is still limited. We assessed the variation in three consecutive components of female fitness: the probability of reproduction, litter size and juvenile survival in relation to environmental and human factors in a solitary carnivore, the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), occurring in human-dominated landscapes in Scandinavia. We used demographic data from 57 radio-collared adult females between 1995–2011 (126 radio-years). Overall, the yearly probability of female reproduction was 0.80, mean litter size was 2.34 (range 1–4) and the probability to find a female that reproduced in the spring being accompanied by at least one offspring during the subsequent winter was 0.70. We did not find evidence that food availability was a key factor influencing female fitness. Female lynx may adapt to food availability when establishing their home ranges by adopting an obstinate strategy, ensuring a minimum amount of prey necessary for survival and reproduction even during periods of prey scarcity. In human-dominated landscapes, where sufficient prey are available for lynx, mortality risk may have a larger influence on lynx population dynamics compared to food availability. Our results suggest that lynx population dynamics in human-dominated landscapes may be mainly driven by human impacts on survival.},

Here we studied the annual activity patterns of European roe deer in the Bavarian Forest National Park. We investigated the influence of age and sex, the weather, and the individuality. We used sex-specific generalized additive models with variables that considered the age of the animal and also the high-resolution site-specific parameters temperature, precipitation, and snow depth. Data from 20 males and 9 females were gathered continuously with GPS-GSM collars carrying a dual-axis acceleration sensor. Our results indicated that the main factors influencing the activity patterns of the crepuscular roe deer in the Bavarian Forest National Park are the individual, the season, and the time of day, and that weather parameters are secondary. GPS-GSM collars with a dual-axis acceleration sensor allow long-term, continuous, and remote activity monitoring of European roe deer.},

Research and management objectives are sacrificed when the collection of data is seriously flawed, as noted in Romesburg's papers on "reliable information" (Romesburg 1981, 1989, 1991, 1993). My objective is to focus attention on 2 major problems that seem fundamental to much of what we do in widlife field studies: 1) the frequent use of convenience sampling and 2) the use of index values (usually raw counts) purporting to measure "relative abundance." These problems result in a lack of rigor and validity in research and in management decision-making (White 2001).},

abstract = {1.Abundance estimation is a pervasive goal in ecology. The rate of detection by motion-sensitive camera traps can, in principle, provide information on the abundance of many species of terrestrial vertebrates that are otherwise difficult to survey. The random encounter model (REM, Rowcliffe 2008) provides a means estimating abundance from camera trap rate but requires camera sensitivity to be quantified. 2.Here, we develop a method to estimate the area effectively monitored by cameras, which is one of the most important codeterminants of detection rate. Our method borrows from distance sampling theory, applying detection function models to data on the position (distance and angle relative to the camera) where the animals are first detected. Testing the reliability of this approach through simulation, we find that bias depends on the effective detection angle assumed but was generally low at less than 5{\%} for realistic angles typical of camera traps. 3.We adapted standard detection functions to allow for the possibility of smaller animals passing beneath the field of view close to the camera, resulting in reduced detection probability within that zone. Using a further simulation to test this approach, we find that detection distance can be estimated with little or no bias if detection probability is certain for at least some distance from the camera. 4.Applying this method to a 1-year camera trapping data set from Barro Colorado Island, Panama, we show that effective detection distance is related strongly positively to species body mass and weakly negatively to species average speed of movement. There was also a strong seasonal effect, with shorter detection distance during the wet season. Effective detection angle is related more weakly to species body mass, and again strongly to season, with a wider angle in the wet season. 5.This method represents an important step towards practical application of the REM, including abundance estimation for relatively small ({\textless}1kg) species. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

The effects of this illumination were studied sequentially by examining eyes clinically and histologically at varying intervals following light exposure. Retinal lesions were produced in 50{\%} of the eyes in which the tapetal fundus was illuminated through the colorless lens, but did not develop in the nontapetal area with either lens or in the tapetal area when the yellow lens was used. The lesions began as circular areas of increased tapetal granularity followed by loss of retinal transparency, pigmentation, and eventually tapetal hyper-reflectivity. Histologically, initial changes included vacuolation and rupture of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, and vesiculation and shortening of the photoreceptor outer segments. As the post-illumination period increased, much of the RPE eventually became atrophic; the photoreceptor cells were absent almost entirely but the inner retinal layers remained intact. {\textcopyright} 1981 Academic Press Inc.

We investigated the influence of camera flash-type on the behaviour of feral cats by categorising their behavioural response to white-flash and infrared-flash cameras and assessing the frequency with which individual cats were redetected by the same white-flash camera or a different white-flash camera at the same site following their initial detection. We found no evidence that flash type had any influence on the cats' observed behavioural responses towards cameras, or that cats captured by white-flash cameras avoided redetection.

abstract = {An understanding of animal behaviour is important if conservation initiatives are to be effective. However, quantifying the behaviour of wild animals presents significant challenges. Remote-sensing camera traps are becoming increasingly popular survey instruments that have been used to non-invasively study a variety of animal behaviours, yielding key insights into behavioural repertoires. They are well suited to ethological studies and provide considerable opportunities for generating conservation-relevant behavioural data if novel and robust methodological and analytical solutions can be developed. This paper reviews the current state of camera-trap-based ethological studies, describes new and emerging directions in camera-based conservation behaviour, and highlights a number of limitations and considerations of particular relevance for camera-based studies. Three promising areas of study are discussed: (1) documenting anthropogenic impacts on behaviour; (2) incorporating behavioural responses into management planning and (3) using behavioural indicators such as giving up densities and daily activity patterns. We emphasize the importance of reporting methodological details, utilizing emerging camera trap metadata standards and central data repositories for facilitating reproducibility, comparison and synthesis across studies. Behavioural studies using camera traps are in their infancy; the full potential of the technology is as yet unrealized. Researchers are encouraged to embrace conservation-driven hypotheses in order to meet future challenges and improve the efficacy of conservation and management processes.},

The variability between camera trap models and the methods used are considerable, and little is known about how animals respond to camera trap emissions. It has been reported that some animals show a response to camera traps, and in research this is often undesirable so it is important to understand why the animals are disturbed. We conducted laboratory based investigations to test the audio and infrared optical outputs of 12 camera trap models. Camera traps were measured for audio outputs in an anechoic chamber; we also measured ultrasonic (n = 5) and infrared illumination outputs (n = 7) of a subset of the camera trap models. We then compared the perceptive hearing range (n = 21) and assessed the vision ranges (n = 3) of mammals species (where data existed) to determine if animals can see and hear camera traps. We report that camera traps produce sounds that are well within the perceptive range of most mammals' hearing and produce illumination that can be seen by many species.},

abstract = {Large solitary felids often kill large prey items that can provide multiple meals. However, being able to utilize these multiple meals requires that they can cache the meat in a manner that delays its discovery by vertebrate and invertebrate scavengers. Covering the kill with vegetation and snow is a commonly observed strategy among felids. This study investigates the utility of this strategy using observational data from Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx)-killed roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) carcasses, and a set of two experiments focused on vertebrate and invertebrate scavengers, respectively. Lynx-killed roe deer that were covered by snow or vegetation were less likely to have been visited by scavengers. Experimentally-deployed video-monitored roe deer carcasses had significantly longer time prior to discovery by avian scavengers when covered with vegetation. Carcass parts placed in cages that excluded vertebrate scavengers had delayed invertebrate activity when covered with vegetation. All three datasets indicated that covering a kill was a successful caching/anti-scavenger strategy. These results can help explain why lynx functional responses reach plateaus at relatively low kill rates. The success of this anti-scavenging behavior therefore has clear effects on the dynamics of a predator–prey system.},

These patterns are highly variable across regions and seasons even within the same species. However, quantitative data is still lacking, particularly for sympatric species. We monitored the seasonal and diel activity patterns of terrestrial mammals in Hokkaido, Japan. Through an intensive camera-trap survey a total of 13,279 capture events were recorded from eight mammals over 20,344 camera-trap days, i.e., two years. Diel activity patterns were clearly divided into four categories: diurnal (Eurasian red squirrels), nocturnal (raccoon dogs and raccoons), crepuscular (sika deer and mountain hares), and cathemeral (Japanese martens, red foxes, and brown bears). Some crepuscular and cathemeral mammals shifted activity peaks across seasons. Particularly, sika deer changed peaks from twilight during spring-autumn to day-time in winter, possibly because of thermal constraints. Japanese martens were cathemeral during winter-summer, but nocturnal in autumn. We found no clear indication of predator-prey and competitive interactions, suggesting that animal densities are not very high or temporal niche partitioning is absent among the target species. This long-term camera-trap survey was highly cost-effective and provided one of the most detailed seasonal and diel activity patterns in multiple sympatric mammals under natural conditions.},

abstract = {Winter tourism in the European Alps has developed rapidly over the past few decades, leading to the expansion of ski resorts, growing numbers of visitors and a massive increase in snow sport activities such as free-ride skiing and snowboarding, backcountry skiing and snowshoeing. Wildlife is often disturbed by these largely unpredictable activities, and animals may have limited opportunities to adapt. Mountain hares Lepus timidus are affected by this increase in alpine tourism, but their physiological and behavioural reactions to tourist activity are still unknown. We measured the levels of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (GCM) in wild mountain hares living in areas that had no, medium or high levels of tourist activity during winter in 2011. Furthermore, we compared the changes in GCM excretion, behaviour and food intake of six captive mountain hares following predator challenge experiments from early to mid-winter. Our field results showed that GCM excretion is positively correlated with increased tourism intensity. In the predator challenge experiments, hares spent less time resting and grooming (including re-ingesting faecal pellets) during and after the stress treatments. These stress events lead to higher energy demands due to flushing, increased GCM levels, and disrupted the energy intake that hares derive from faeces. We conclude that mountain hares living in areas with frequent human winter recreational activities show changes in physiology and behaviour that demand additional energy in winter, when access to food resources is limited by snow. Synthesis and applications. To bring down the frequency of stress threats for mountain hares, we recommend that managers keep forests inhabited by mountain hares free of tourism infrastructure and retain undisturbed forest patches within skiing areas. Other species such as black grouse Tetrao tetrix and/or capercaillie Tetrao urogallus are also likely to benefit from such management activities because they share similar habitat requirements with mountain hares. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

While many methods exist to estimate abundance from individually identifiable animals, it is much more difficult to estimate abundance of unmarked animals. One step toward noninvasive abundance estimation is the use of passive detectors such as remote cameras or acoustic recording devices. However, existing methods for estimating abundance from cameras for unmarked animals are limited by variable detection probability and have not taken full advantage of the information in camera trapping rate. We developed a time to event (TTE) model to estimate abundance from trapping rate. This estimate requires independent estimates of animal movement, so we collapsed the sampling occasions to create a space to event (STE) model that is not sensitive to movement rate. We further simplified the STE model into an instantaneous sampling (IS) estimator that applies fixed-area counts to cameras. The STE and IS models utilize time-lapse photographs to eliminate the variability in detection probability that comes with motion-sensor photographs. We evaluated the three methods with simulations and performed a case study to estimate elk (Cervus canadensis) abundance from remote camera trap data in Idaho. Simulations demonstrated that the TTE model is sensitive to movement rate, but the STE and IS methods are unbiased regardless of movement. In our case study, elk abundance estimates were comparable to those from a recent aerial survey in the area, demonstrating that these new methods allow biologists to estimate abundance from unmarked populations without tracking individuals over time.},

abstract = {The movement patterns of free-living lynx, Lynx lynx, were studied by radiotelemetry in Bia{\l}owie{\.{z}}a Primeval Forest, Poland. Eighteen lynx were fitted with radio-collars and their movements were recorded by continuous 24-h sequences and daily relocations. On average, lynx moved 7.2 km per day, and males covered longer distances than females (9.0 and 6.8 km, respectively). In males, the daily movement distances were 56{\%} longer during the mating season (January-March) than during the rest of the year. Females moved 43{\%} longer distances during the period of intensive care for kittens (May-August) than in other periods. Males covered longer routes than females and stayed far from the location of the previous day. Females' movements were more concentrated as they moved intensively but stayed close to the previous day's location. The lynx travelled with an average speed of 1.2 km h-1 with males moving faster than females (1.5 and 1.0 km h-1, respectively). Males travelled even faster (on average 1.9 km h-1) during the mating season. During a day lynx utilised an area-comprising only 1.7{\%}-2.6{\%} of their annual home range. The home ranges were used with rather low intensity (31 to 50 m of lynx route per 1 km2 of home range), still lower in males than in females. The lynx moved the longest distances (14 km day-1, on average) on days when they failed to kill large prey, and the shortest ones (2.8 km day-1) on the first day after making a kill. The results suggest that males tend to maximise their reproductive success by increasing an opportunity to meet receptive females, whereas females increase their reproductive success via adjusting their behaviour to the needs of kittens.},

abstract = {Human recreation can negatively affect wildlife, particularly on weekends when human activity is highest (i.e., the weekend effect). Much of what we understand about the weekend effect is based on research conducted on diurnal species, which have greater temporal overlap with humans. Because nocturnal species generally avoid times when humans are active, they are likely less affected by anthropogenic activity on weekends. Our objective was to test the weekend effect in relation to the degree of nocturnality of mammals in a recreational area. We predicted that as nocturnality increased, the effect of human activity would decrease. To address our objective, we placed 50 remote cameras along the Diamond Fork River in Utah from January to June 2015. We found that three out of the four focal species supported our predictions. Mule deer (crepuscular) reduced activity throughout our entire study area during weekends and avoided campgrounds. Beavers and mountain lions (both nocturnal) did not negatively respond to increased human activity. Raccoons (nocturnal) reduced activity during weekends, but only within campground areas. Our findings indicate that as the temporal overlap increases between wildlife and humans, so does the influence that humans have on wildlife.},

abstract = {Conservation translocations, including reintroductions, are practices that are vital to restoring biodiversity and ecosystem function within conservation schemes globally. Sadly, population translocations have had a poor success rate historically. At a time where biodiversity is constantly decreasing, improving translocation success is vital for future conservation schemes. Often, to improve success, the selection of individuals is based on genetic characteristics and behaviours linked directly to survival. Further development to improve selection is proposed within this paper using animal personality. The study took place opportunistically to test how personality, in particular an animal's boldness/timidness, may influence a population restoration of red squirrels into the Ogwen Valley, North Wales. Despite frequent translocations, data on how boldness and timidness may affect the establishment of this species are low. Testing was performed on key survival behaviours and boldness/timidness pre-release. This was performed via video data collection and identification of key behaviours that could be used to identify boldness or behaviours that could be linked to reduced fitness once released. Encounters at different distance intervals were monitored post-release via camera trapping to identify if boldness/timidness may change the furthest encounter distance of focal animals away from their release site. Relationships between the period for an individual to reappear post-threat was significantly linked to boldness, with other behavioural results and the encounter distance also showing trends of a potential relationship. Our results indicate that bolder individuals have a higher chance of expressing behavioural traits that will increase exposure to risks and, therefore, reduce the likelihood of successfully establishing populations. However, the small sample size of this study means that further research is needed. We suggest that during early stages of conservation translocation programmes, personality testing for boldness should become common practice, and we recommend selecting timid individuals for an initial release to improve population establishment, with bolder individuals utilised later to expand population distribution.},

abstract = {Cone flicker threshold rises as the rods dark adapt, though the cone threshold to continuous light remains constant. The rise is normally about 1 log unit, but in certain patients who complain of night blindness it may be as great as 2.5 log units. In these persons the kinetics of the rod-cone interaction are those of the recovery of rod sensitivity. The rods impose a low-pass filter on the cones. This effect is absent in congenital nyctalopia and X-linked retinoschisis. We suggest that cone flicker is maintained through a feedback system involving horizontal cells, and when the rod dark current returns in dark adaptation this feedback is altered. Rod cone interaction thus tests rod dark current, and cases of abnormal interaction in patients with retinitis pigmentosa occur, which indicate that the transduction mechanism and the membrane dark current may be differentially affected. There have been several attempts to use psycho-physical methods to localise disease conditions to given retinal layers, notably by Enoch and his collaborators ,' but the methods involved have often been complex and time consuming and have made considerable demands on the patient. However, recently Goldberg et al.2 have described an increase in the cone flicker threshold which occurs as the rods dark adapt. This inhibition of cones by rods has been known for many years,3 but in the form described the phenomenon is robust, simple to elicit, and is familiar to clinicians. The interaction is developed at a specific retinal site. It therefore promises to be of considerable use in the investigation of retinal disease. Recently properties of the rod-cone interaction have been described.' This paper presents additional findings which help to define the nature and the site of the interaction. Equipment for a clinical test is described together with observations which show that the interaction is abnormal in a number of clinical conditions. These provide strong evidence about the site of the interaction , and suggest that study of the phenomenon will increase our understanding of various causes of night blindness. Material and methods EQUIPMENT Most of the initial work was done with the computer-Correspondence to Professor G B Arden, Institute of Ophthal-mology, Judd Street, London WCIH 9QS. ised light-emitting diode (LED) perimeter described by Ernst et al.7 This placed 10 green or red spots of light anywhere in the visual field. In the present experiments a site 100 nasally was usually examined. Additional experiments were performed with similar equipment but manually controlled. In one version the filtered LED (light output centred at 660 nm) was attached to one end of a flexible light-pipe, the other end of which was inserted through a hole in a piece of white card, which could be illuminated to produce a dim blue surround. The (460 nm) light which was used to illuminate the surround was provided by a Grass PS22C stroboscope fitted with neutral and colour filters.89 The mean light output was altered by changing the flash rate between 40 and 60 pulses per second (pps) so that, with all the filters in place, the surround was at the rod absolute detection threshold. Under the conditions of the experiments the blue light appeared continuous. The final equipment utilised both blue and red LEDs. These were driven by a pulse technique. The advantages of this drive, which has been developed from devices previously described in detail,7"' are that linear output can be maintained over six decades of intensity: circuits which depend on variable current driving" provide linear output over a more limited range of intensities. In addition the pulse driving circuit can provide various stimulus waveforms. Pulses, sine waves, increments, and decrements of light intensity can readily be achieved, and various spatial outputs, for example discs, annuli, chequerboards, etc., are easily realisable. In the present experiments only uniform patches of light were used, and usually flicker was produced by abruptly turning the stimulus light on and off. However, the luminance could easily be made to change in a sinusoidal fashion, and then the modulation depth of the stimulus, defined as (Imax-I.jn)/(Imax+Imin), could be varied, so that the modulation thresholds could be determined for every temporal frequency at the same mean level of illumination.},

abstract = {1. Density estimation is of fundamental importance in wildlife management. The use of camera traps to estimate animal density has so far been restricted to capture-recapture analysis of species with individually identifiable markings. This study developed a method that eliminates the requirement for individual recognition of animals by modelling the underlying process of contact between animals and cameras. 2. The model provides a factor that linearly scales trapping rate with density, depending on two key biological variables (average animal group size and day range) and two characteristics of the camera sensor (distance and angle within which it detects animals). 3. We tested the approach in an enclosed animal park with known abundances of four species, obtaining accurate estimates in three out of four cases. Inaccuracy in the fourth species was because of biased placement of cameras with respect to the distribution of this species. 4. Synthesis and applications. Subject to unbiased camera placement and accurate measurement of model parameters, this method opens the possibility of reduced labour costs for estimating wildlife density and may make estimation possible where it has not been previously. We provide guidelines on the trapping effort required to obtain reasonably precise estimates. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

Little information is available, however, about individual differences in temperament for wild animals. For bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis, ewes captured as part of a long-term study, we compared behaviour during handling to behaviour in the field and reproductive history. We considered 'bold' ewes those that were frequently trapped during the summer, and assigned to each ewe a docility index based on her behaviour during handling. Measurements of temperament for the same individual at different captures were highly consistent. Temperament was not affected by reproductive status or age, nor was it related to body mass. Correlations between behaviour at the trap and in the field were weak and mostly nonsignificant, suggesting that temperament is domain specific rather than domain general. Bold ewes tended to start reproducing earlier and have higher weaning success than shy ewes. Variability in temperamental traits in the study population could be maintained by life-history trade-offs and by yearly changes in selective pressures.

abstract = {Objectives: The phenomenon of 'eye-shine' is seen in a variety of animal species, and is generally thought to be related to the presence of an intraocular reflecting structure, the tapetum lucidum. The tapetum lucidum is a biologic reflector system that is a common feature in the eyes of vertebrates. It normally functions to provide the light-sensitive retinal cells with a second opportunity for photon-photoreceptor stimulation, thereby enhancing visual sensitivity at low light levels. The tapetum lucidum is presented here according to a classification based on the location, as well as the composition, of this reflective layer. Finally, the physical and chemical properties, as well as the origins of the different tapeta lucida, are discussed and compared. Methods: The anatomic and biochemical aspects of the tapetum lucidum in various vertebrates are examined. Morphologic observations were made from paraffin and plastic embedded specimens. Specimens were treated with traditional stains and observed by light and transmission electron microscopy. Results: Some species (primates, squirrels, birds, red kangaroo and pig) do not have this structure and they usually are diurnal animals. In vertebrates, the tapetum lucidum exhibits diverse structure, organization and composition. Therefore, the retinal tapetum (teleosts, crocodilians, marsupials, fruit bat), the choroidal guanine tapetum (elasmobranchs), the choroidal tapetum cellulosum (carnivores, rodents, cetacea), and the choroidal tapetum fibrosum (cow, sheep, goat, horse) are described. Conclusions: The tapetum lucidum represents a remarkable example of neural cell and tissue specialization as an adaptation to a dim light environment and, despite these differences, all tapetal variants act to increase retinal sensitivity by reflecting light back through the photoreceptor layer. These variations regarding both its location and structure, as well as the choice of reflective material, may represent selective visual adaptations associated with their feeding behavior, in response to the use of specific wavelengths and amount of reflectance required.},

Data were collected in the period 2010-2017 and the trap effort was 30 158 camera days from 21 locations. Most of the mammals surveyed showed activity at night and twilight hours (71{\%} of the pictures). The hare was most active among all and dominant at night. In many respects it is similar to the activity of a raccoon dog, which type can be defined as nocturnal too. Unlike a hare, a raccoon dog has a weak peak in the daytime and less activity in the night. Badgers movements are confined to the twilight and nighttime. The share of nocturnal activity of large ungulates such as elk and wild boar was approximately the same and amounted to about 45{\%} of all registrations. The wild boar is slightly more active during the day and in the evening and is not active at all in the morning. The elk is active in the morning, and in the daytime and to a lesser extent in the evening. The lynx and the bear have similar cathemeral activity patterns: Almost half of all their meetings occurred at daylight hours and only slightly - less than 40{\%} - at night. The brown bear had the maximum number of registrations in the daytime among all the studied species. Despite the fact that the main object of lynx feeding in the reserve is the hare, there was no high degree of overlap between them ($\Delta$= 0.75). In the group of large carnivores, the Wolf was noticeably distinguished, more than half of its registrations were at night, and a third - on daytime. Daily activities of the Wolf and its main prey elk showed a large overlap ($\Delta$= 0.89). The seasonal variations of daily activity of all species were also shown. According to the results of factor analysis, each of the studied species was divided into one of three separate groups. The first group included species with a tendency to nocturnal activity (Wolf, elk, hare, badger, and raccoon dog), the second group - cathemeral animals (bear and lynx). In the third group was only the wild boar, whose activity was associated with the evening hours. This is the first long-term continuous camera trap survey in Russia and it provides detailed daily activity patterns for multiple large and medium-sized sympatric mammals.},

abstract = {For group-living animals, the ability to discriminate between familiar individuals and strangers may allow reduced agonistic behaviour between holders of neighbouring territories, termed the 'dear enemy' effect. We tested the hypothesis that Eurasian badgers can discriminate between self-, neighbour- and alien- (unknown) group faeces placed near their main sett. We carried out a series of controlled field experiments over a 12-month period at the main setts of three badger groups occupying contiguous territories. The experimental design used two different treatments: 'alien treatment' involved the display of self-group scents with alien-group scents and 'neighbour treatment' involved the display of self-group scents with neighbour-group scents. Badgers showed heightened behavioural responses towards alien- compared with self-group scents, but there was no significant difference in response to neighbour- relative to self-group scents. The relative responses towards alien-group scents were greatest during the breeding seasons, but there were no significant seasonal differences in the responses to neighbour-group versus self-group scents. In undisturbed badger populations, levels of aggression between neighbouring territory-holders are likely to be kept relatively low through neighbour recognition. However, increased levels of aggression will be shown towards dispersing or itinerant (alien) badgers, especially during periods such as the breeding season when the potential threats to the long-term fitness of territory owners are greatest. This behaviour may reduce the effectiveness of management strategies involving the culling of group-living wildlife hosts to reduce levels of livestock or human disease. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

@article{Linnell2001,
abstract = {Annual and seasonal home ranges were calculated for 47 Eurasian lynx in four Scandinavian study sites (two in Sweden and two in Norway). The observed home ranges were the largest reported for the species, with study site averages ranging from 600 to 1400 km2 for resident males and from 300 to 800 km2 for resident females. When home range sizes were compared to the size of protected areas (national parks and nature reserves) in Scandinavia, it was concluded that very few protected areas contained sufficient forest to provide space for more than a few individuals. As a direct consequence of this, most lynx need to be conserved in the multiuse seminatural forest habitats that cover large areas in Scandinavia. This conservation strategy leads to a number of conflicts with some land uses (sheep and semidomestic reindeer herding, and roe deer hunters), but not all (forestry and moose harvest). Accordingly research must be aimed at understanding the ecology of these conflicts, and finding solutions.},

abstract = {Animals selecting habitats often have to consider many factors, e.g., food and cover for safety. However, each habitat type often lacks an adequate mixture of these factors. Analyses of habitat selection using resource selection functions (RSFs) for animal radiotelemetry data typically ignore trade-offs, and the fact that these may change during an animal's daily foraging and resting rhythm on a short-term basis. This may lead to changes in the relative use of habitat types if availability differs among individual home ranges, called functional responses in habitat selection. Here, we identify such functional responses and their underlying behavioral mechanisms by estimating RSFs through mixed-effects logistic regression of telemetry data on 62 female red deer (Cervus elaphus) in Norway. Habitat selection changed with time of day and activity, suggesting a trade-off in habitat selection related to forage quantity or quality vs. shelter. Red deer frequently used pastures offering abundant forage and little canopy cover during nighttime when actively foraging, while spending much of their time in forested habitats with less forage but more cover during daytime when they are more often inactive. Selection for pastures was higher when availability was low and decreased with increasing availability. Moreover, we show for the first time that in the real world with forest habitats also containing some forage, there was both increasing selection of pastures (i.e., not proportional use) and reduced time spent in pastures (i.e., not constant time use) with lowered availability of pastures within the home range. Our study demonstrates that landscape-level habitat composition modifies the trade-off between food and cover for large herbivorous mammals. Consequently, landscapes are likely to differ in their vulnerability to crop damage and threat to biodiversity from grazing. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {The eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, a global biodiversity hotspot, is threatened by habitat degradation. Conservation actions are required in this region, but limited knowledge of large and medium-sized mammals is hampering conservation planning. Using 149 camera traps, we surveyed large and medium-sized mammals in Xionglongxi Provincial Nature Reserve and adjacent areas, on the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, during September 2016-May 2017. We obtained 5,752 independent captures of 29 large and medium-sized mammal species, including 13 that are globally threatened and 22 that are nationally threatened in China. Carnivores were especially diverse, with 16 species recorded. Of particular significance was our detection of seven felid species, including the leopard Panthera pardus and the snow leopard Panthera uncia. Our record of the Chinese mountain cat Felis bieti extends the known range of this species. We documented new upper elevation limits for eight species. There was elevational overlap between the leopard and the snow leopard, suggesting potential competition between the two species. The grey wolf Canis lupus and the leopard were the dominant predators, and the woolly hare Lepus oiostolus and several species of ungulates were the most frequently photographed prey species. The study area maintains a significant community of large and medium-sized mammals, which is more diverse than in other areas on the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. We recommend the establishment of a larger nature reserve of national protection status in the region of the Xionglongxi Provincial Nature Reserve, to protect the unique subalpine and alpine ecosystems in this area.},

abstract = {We studied daily activity patterns of 19 (7 males and 12 females) adult red deer (Cervus elaphus) by using continuous tracking sessions in Bia{\l}owieza National Park (BNP), Poland, from 2001 to 2004. Male and female red deer were active throughout the day and night during all seasons, with several peaks in activity during the 24-h period, although both sexes tended to be more active during the day in winter. There were no significant differences between males and females in mean time active (8 h/day for both sexes), mean length of activity bouts (42 min), and mean number of activity bouts (12 bouts/day). Additionally, neither sex showed seasonal differences in hours active, bout length, or number of bouts per day. However, rainfall affected activity of males, whereas ambient temperature and snowfall affected activity of females. Although red deer are sexually dimorphic, which often leads to differences in movements and social groupings, our results suggest that their general activity patterns are influenced less by these sexual differences and more by the constraints of feeding and rumination, daily abiotic factors, and possibly predation risk from wolves (Canis lupus). Red deer in BNP did not exhibit strong bimodal peaks in activity at dawn and dusk as shown in previous studies, likely because strict limits on human activities in BNP allowed red deer to base their activity more on natural factors than on human-related factors. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Society of Mammalogists.},

abstract = {Camera trapping has become an increasingly widespread tool for wildlife ecologists, with large numbers of studies relying on photo capture rates or presence/absence information. It is increasingly clear that camera placement can directly impact this kind of data, yet these biases are poorly understood. We used a paired camera design to investigate the effect of small-scale habitat features on species richness estimates, and capture rate and detection probability of several mammal species in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, USA. Cameras were deployed at either log features or on game trails with a paired camera at a nearby random location. Overall capture rates were significantly higher at trail and log cameras compared to their paired random cameras, and some species showed capture rates as much as 9.7 times greater at feature-based cameras. We recorded more species at both log (17) and trail features (15) than at their paired control cameras (13 and 12 species, respectively), yet richness estimates were indistinguishable after 659 and 385 camera nights of survey effort, respectively. We detected significant increases (ranging from 11–33{\%}) in detection probability for five species resulting from the presence of game trails. For six species detection probability was also influenced by the presence of a log feature. This bias was most pronounced for the three rodents investigated, where in all cases detection probability was substantially higher (24.9–38.2{\%}) at log cameras. Our results indicate that small-scale factors, including the presence of game trails and other features, can have significant impacts on species detection when camera traps are employed. Significant biases may result if the presence and quality of these features are not documented and either incorporated into analytical procedures, or controlled for in study design.},

abstract = {Camera trapping has recently been introduced as an unbiased and practical method for monitoring tiger abundance. In a high density area in the Royal Bardia National Park in lowland Nepal, we tested this method by trapping very intensively within a 25 km2 area to determine the true number of animals in that area. We then tested the effect of study design by sub-sampling the data set using varying distances between trap stations and by reducing the number of trapping nights at each station. We compared these numbers with the density estimates generated by the capture-recapture models of the program CAPTURE. Both distance between traps and trapping duration greatly influenced the results. For example, increasing the inter-trap distance from 1 to 2.1 km and reducing the trapping duration per station from 15 to 10 nights reduced the number of tigers captured by 25{\%}. A significant decrease in trapping rates during successive 5-night periods suggested that our tigers became trap-shy, probably because of the photo flash and because they detected the camera traps from cues from impression pads 50 m from the traps. A significant behavioural response was also confirmed by the program CAPTURE. The best capture-recapture model selected by the computer program (Mbh) gave precise estimates from data collected by the initial 1 km spacing of traps. However, when we omitted data from half the number of traps, thus decreasing the sampling effort to a more realistic level for monitoring purposes, the program CAPTURE underestimated the true number of tigers. Most probably, this was due to a combination of trap shyness and the way the study was designed. Within larger protected areas, total count from intensive, stratified subsampling is suggested as a complementary technique to the capture-recapture method, since it circumvents the problem of trap shyness. {\textcopyright} 2004 The Zoological Society of London.},

abstract = {The lynx population in Scandinavia has been monitored since the 1990's using snow-tracking to detect the presence of family groups. Parts of Norway have experienced winters with limited snow cover in recent years, creating a need to find alternatives to our current monitoring meth- ods. This report summarize experiences from a pilot project testing camera traps for monitoring lynx in 3 study areas in southeastern Norway. The goal has been to test if camera traps increase the number of observations of family groups, and if we can use individual recognition from im- ages to calculate the density of lynx using spatial capture-recapture methods. Although camera traps are a standard method for lynx monitoring in many countries, there is a need to evaluate their suitability in Norway where we need to monitor very large areas with very low density lynx populations. Camera traps were deployed at 297 localities in the 3 study areas, in parts of Oslo, Akershus and {\O}stfold Counties (Region 4, 2010-2015), Vestfold County with adjoining areas of Buskerud and Telemark (Region 2, 2012-2015) and Oppland County (Region 3, 2014-2015). All fieldwork was conducted in collaboration with the Norwegian Hunters and Anglers Association in Oppland and Akershus, with assistance from students and volunteers. We photographed lynx 573 times in 112 locations during 120 453 camera-days. During the same period, we observed other species 42 435 times. In all three areas cameras increased the num- ber of observations of family groups. Fourteen of 18 family groups detected by the public and reported to the National Large Predator Monitoring Program (Rovdata) within the study areas during all study winters had at least one observation from camera-traps. We compared estimates of the number of family groups made by the traditional methods (lynx tracks in snow and grouping by distance criteria, AK) within the study areas with estimates based on data from camera traps. Estimates based on AK were 23 family groups for all years and all areas combined, and corre- sponding estimates solely based on data from camera traps were for 20 family groups. We estimated densities of lynx in Regions 4 and 2 using spatial capture-recapture methods, and in both areas lynx densities decreased during the study period. In Region 2 densities decreased from 2.1 (±0.7) lynx/1000 km2 in 2012/13 to 1.2 (±0.4) in 2014/15. In Region 4 lynx densities decreased from 2.0 (±0.5) and 2.9 (±1.5) lynx/1000 km2 the first 2 years to 1.3 (±0.4), 0.6 (±0.1) and 0.4 (±0.2) lynx/1000 km2 the last 3 winters. We followed nine lynx with GPS collars within these study areas, and all marked lynx were cap- tured by camera traps. Female lynx were photographed on average 10 times per year, while male lynx on average were photographed 27 times per year. We demonstrate that camera traps can be a useful supplement to the current snow-based mon- itoring of lynx family groups in Scandinavia. A more intensive system of camera traps may also provide estimates of lynx densities with a measure of the precision in the estimates. Our experi- ence here is also that the involvement of local people in the operation of the camera traps may reduce conflicts. We need to further develop camera traps as a method to be used in long-term studies of demographic parameters of lynx, behavioral studies, habitat selection, effects of hu- man disturbance and interactions with other species. It is also important to evaluate the potential of camera traps as a tool to monitor multiple species in forest ecosystems. John},

abstract = {Regression models such as the Cox proportional hazards model have had increasing use in modelling and estimating the prognosis of patients with a variety of diseases. Many applications involve a large number of variables to be modelled using a relatively small patient sample. Problems of overfitting and of identifying important covariates are exacerbated in analysing prognosis because the accuracy of a model is more a function of the number of events than of the sample size. We used a general index of predictive discrimination to measure the ability of a model developed on training samples of varying sizes to predict survival in an independent test sample of patients suspected of having coronary artery disease. We compared three methods of model fitting: (1) standard ‘step‐up' variable selection, (2) incomplete principal components regression, and (3) Cox model regression after developing clinical indices from variable clusters. We found regression using principal components to offer superior predictions in the test sample, whereas regression using indices offers easily interpretable models nearly as good as the principal components models. Standard variable selection has a number of deficiencies. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1984 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

We examined anthropogenic effects on mammal diel activity patterns, conducting a meta-analysis of 76 studies of 62 species from six continents. Our global study revealed a strong effect of humans on daily patterns of wildlife activity. Animals increased their nocturnality by an average factor of 1.36 in response to human disturbance. This finding was consistent across continents, habitats, taxa, and human activities. As the global human footprint expands, temporal avoidance of humans may facilitate human-wildlife coexistence. However, such responses can result in marked shifts away from natural patterns of activity, with consequences for fitness, population persistence, community interactions, and evolution.},

abstract = {The use of spatially explicit models (SEMs) in ecology has grown enormously in the past two decades. One major advancement has been that fine-scale details of landscapes, and of spatially dependent biological processes, such as dispersal and invasion, can now be simulated with great precision, due to improvements in computer technology. Many areas of modeling have shifted toward a focus on capturing these fine-scale details, to improve mechanistic understanding of ecosystems. However, spatially implicit models (SIMs) have played a dominant role in ecology, and arguments have been made that SIMs, which account for the effects of space without specifying spatial positions, have an advantage of being simpler and more broadly applicable, perhaps contributing more to understanding. We address this debate by comparing SEMs and SIMs in examples from the past few decades of modeling research. We argue that, although SIMs have been the dominant approach in the incorporation of space in theoretical ecology, SEMs have unique advantages for addressing pragmatic questions concerning species populations or communities in specific places, because local conditions, such as spatial heterogeneities, organism behaviors, and other contingencies, produce dynamics and patterns that usually cannot be incorporated into simpler SIMs. SEMs are also able to describe mechanisms at the local scale that can create amplifying positive feedbacks at that scale, creating emergent patterns at larger scales, and therefore are important to basic ecological theory. We review the use of SEMs at the level of populations, interacting populations, food webs, and ecosystems and argue that SEMs are not only essential in pragmatic issues, but must play a role in the understanding of causal relationships on landscapes.},

abstract = {The availability of vertebrate hosts is a major determinant of the occurrence of ticks and tick-borne zoonoses in natural and anthropogenic ecosystems and thus drives disease risk for wildlife, livestock, and humans. However, it remains challenging to quantify the availability of vertebrate hosts in field settings, particularly for medium-sized to large-bodied mammals. Here, we present a method that uses camera traps to quantify the availability of warm-bodied vertebrates to ticks. The approach is to deploy camera traps at questing height at a representative sample of random points across the study area, measure the average photographic capture rate for vertebrate species, and then correct these rates for the effective detection distance. The resulting "passage rate" is a standardized measure of the frequency at which vertebrates approach questing ticks, which we show is proportional to contact rate. A field test across twenty 1-ha forest plots in the Netherlands indicated that this method effectively captures differences in wildlife assemblage composition between sites. Also, the relative abundances of three life stages of the sheep tick Ixodes ricinus from drag sampling were correlated with passage rates of deer, which agrees with the known association with this group of host species, suggesting that passage rate effectively reflects the availability of medium- to large-sized hosts to ticks. This method will facilitate quantitative studies of the relationship between densities of questing ticks and the availability of different vertebrate species-wild as well as domesticated species-in natural and anthropogenic settings.},

abstract = {Abstract: Estimating predator abundance can be challenging. Many predators are inherently difficult to detect due to their low population densities, large home ranges and cryptic behaviour. Detection rates derived from camera traps, spotlight surveys and track counts in sand plots are often used as indices of abundance. However, many factors can influence a species' detection rate and the extent to which it might reflect the species' actual abundance. I investigated the relationships between detections, abundance and activity of two sympatric predators, the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) and the feral cat (Felis catus). I used camera traps to detect devils and feral cats across eastern Tasmania in southern Australia, where devil populations have progressively and variably declined since 1996 following the spread of the fatal devil facial tumour disease. Devil and cat detections on individual cameras were negatively correlated; however, this was unrelated to abundance. While cats and devils were detected at nearly all of the same sites, cats appeared to avoid devils over short distances, suggesting that negative relationships in detections at the camera scale may reflect fine-scale behavioural avoidance rather than suppression of abundance. These findings highlight the importance of understanding avoidance behaviour when designing surveys to detect predators and when using indices to infer interactions or numerical relationships among sympatric predators. These findings also provide a cautionary tale that highlights the need to consider alternative hypotheses to explain observed patterns, as the implications for species conservation and management outcomes could vary dramatically. Significance statement: Indices derived from detection rates are often used to estimate and monitor changes in the abundance of predators and to infer numerical and behavioural relationships among sympatric predators and between predators and their prey. In this study, I present camera detection data for two sympatric predators, the Tasmanian devil (5–12 kg) and the feral cat (2–6 kg), to illustrate that negative relationships in commonly used abundance indices may in fact reflect avoidance behaviour rather than a suppression of abundance. By simultaneously measuring avoidance behaviour across multiple spatial and temporal scales, I demonstrate that relationships in abundance indices vary markedly over different scales. These findings have significant implications for designing surveys to detect predators and for using indices to infer relationships in sympatric predator abundance.},

abstract = {Camera traps have become an important tool in wildlife monitoring. However, an issue in interpreting their data in statistical analyses of population densities, demography or behaviour is that the probability of detecting the target animals and their behaviours may vary depending on environmental and methodological factors. A specific problem is the type of flash used in the camera trap, as animals may react differently to different flash types and change their avoidance or habituation behaviour accordingly over time. Here, we provide the first systematic test of the impact of flash type in studies of red deer (Cervus elaphus) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), based on an analysis of behavioural responses to white, standard infrared and black flashes during 900 camera trap deployments in the Bavarian Forest National Park and the Northern Black Forest. The results revealed that both deer species were more likely to react to standard infrared than to black flash, but trigger delays prevented comparisons to white flash. Red deer reacted more frequently to camera traps than did roe deer, and responses were more common in the Northern Black Forest than in the Bavarian Forest National Park, where hunting is severely restricted. Contrary to our expectations, camera trapping rates of free-ranging deer did not significantly decline over time for any flash type or species. Despite the lack of evidence for avoidance behaviour, we recommend the use of black flash for behavioural studies of deer populations to minimize the risk of introducing a source of disturbance whereas infrared and white flash are equally suitable for determinations of demographic parameters.},

abstract = {Camera traps deployed in grids or stratified random designs are a well-established survey tool for wildlife but there has been little evaluation of study design parameters. We used an empirical subsampling approach involving 2,225 camera deployments run at 41 study areas around the world to evaluate three aspects of camera trap study design (number of sites, duration and season of sampling) and their influence on the estimation of three ecological metrics (species richness, occupancy and detection rate) for mammals. We found that 25–35 camera sites were needed for precise estimates of species richness, depending on scale of the study. The precision of species-level estimates of occupancy ($\psi$) was highly sensitive to occupancy level, with {\textless}20 camera sites needed for precise estimates of common ($\psi$ {\textgreater} 0.75) species, but more than 150 camera sites likely needed for rare ($\psi$ {\textless} 0.25) species. Species detection rates were more difficult to estimate precisely at the grid level due to spatial heterogeneity, presumably driven by unaccounted habitat variability factors within the study area. Running a camera at a site for 2 weeks was most efficient for detecting new species, but 3–4 weeks were needed for precise estimates of local detection rate, with no gains in precision observed after 1 month. Metrics for all mammal communities were sensitive to seasonality, with 37{\%}–50{\%} of the species at the sites we examined fluctuating significantly in their occupancy or detection rates over the year. This effect was more pronounced in temperate sites, where seasonally sensitive species varied in relative abundance by an average factor of 4–5, and some species were completely absent in one season due to hibernation or migration. We recommend the following guidelines to efficiently obtain precise estimates of species richness, occupancy and detection rates with camera trap arrays: run each camera for 3–5 weeks across 40–60 sites per array. We recommend comparisons of detection rates be model based and include local covariates to help account for small-scale variation. Furthermore, comparisons across study areas or times must account for seasonality, which could have strong impacts on mammal communities in both tropical and temperate sites.},

Some of the catastrophic consequences of light for certain taxonomic groups are well known, such as the deaths of migratory birds around tall lighted structures, and those of hatchling sea turtles disoriented by lights on their natal beaches.

abstract = {The findings of medical research are often met with considerable scepticism, even when they have apparently come from studies with sound methodologies that have been subjected to appropriate statistical analysis. This is perhaps particularly the case with respect to epidemiological findings that suggest that some aspect of everyday life is bad for people. Indeed, one recent popular history, the medical journalist James Le Fanu's The Rise and Fall of Modern Medicine, went so far as to suggest that the solution to medicine's ills would be the closure of all departments of epidemiology.1One contributory factor is that the medical literature shows a strong tendency to accentuate the positive; positive outcomes are more likely to be reported than null results.2–4 By this means alone a host of purely chance findings will be published, as by conventional reasoning examining 20 associations will produce one result that is “significant at P = 0.05” by chance alone. If only positive findings are published then they may be mistakenly considered to be of importance rather than being the necessary chance results produced by the application of criteria for meaningfulness based on statistical significance. As many studies contain long questionnaires collecting information on hundreds of variables, and measure a wide range of potential outcomes, several false positive findings are virtually guaranteed. The high volume and often contradictory nature5 of medical research findings, however, is not only because of publication bias. A more fundamental problem is the widespread misunderstanding of the nature of statistical significance.},

abstract = {Efficient and reliable methods for estimating animal density are essential to wildlife conservation and management. Camera trapping is an increasingly popular tool in this area of wildlife research, with further potential arising from technological improvements, such as video-recording functions that allow for behavioural observation of animals. This information may be useful in the estimation of animal density, even without individual recognition. Although several models applicable to species lacking individual markings (i.e. unmarked populations) have been developed, a methodology incorporating behavioural information from videos has not yet been established. We developed a likelihood-based model: the random encounter and staying time (REST) model. It is an extension of the random encounter model by Rowcliffe et al. (J Appl Ecol 45:1228, 2008). The REST model describes the relationship among staying time, trapping rate, and density, which is estimable using a frequentist or Bayesian approach. We tested the reliability and feasibility of the REST model using Monte Carlo simulations. We also applied the approach in the African rainforest and compared the results with those of a line-transect survey. The simulations showed that the REST model provided unbiased estimates of animal density. Even when animal movement speeds varied among individuals, and when animals travelled in pairs, the model provided unbiased density estimates. However, the REST model was vulnerable to unsynchronized activity patterns among individuals. Moreover, it is necessary to use a camera model with a fast and reliable infrared sensor and to set the camera trap's parameters appropriately (i.e. video length, delay period). The field survey showed that the staying time of two ungulate species in the African rainforest exhibited good fit with a temporal parametric distribution, and the REST model provided density estimates consistent with those of a line-transect survey. Synthesis and applications. The random encounter and staying time model provides better efficiency and higher feasibility than the random encounter model in estimating animal density without individual recognition. Careful application of the random encounter and staying time model provides the potential to estimate density of many ground-dwelling vertebrates lacking individually recognizable markings, and thus should be an effective method for population monitoring.},

abstract = {Female jaguars have lower capture rates because they move less, have smaller territories and use habitat differently than males. Also, I found evidence that suggests that females may avoid camera traps and thus cause a sex bias in camera trap records. Most records of females (83{\%}) were from the first year of a 54 month study (2005–2013), and 79{\%} of those were during the first six months of camera trapping. Males were also captured at a greater rate during the first six months of sampling (39{\%} of all records), and they were recorded continuously when camera traps were installed on roads (in contrast to females). A previous study found individual heterogeneity in capture probability and estimated 78{\%} annual survival probability for the local population over five sampling periods. If population size was declining, a bias towards a greater rate of decline in females (or the disappearance of only females) is unlikely (males continued to be captured), and does not explain the fourfold reduction in the capture success of females after the first six months of sampling (four females were present throughout the entire first period). The deliberate tendency of females to avoid camera traps, more than males, as I suggest here, may cause a bias in determining both population size and sex ratios in jaguars, as well as an important underestimation of reproduction, thereby biasing estimates of population structure. This issue is important when using camera-traps to examine feline population biology and requires further evaluation.},

abstract = {Humans and old world primates have trichromatic color vision based on three spectral types of cone [long-wavelength (L-), middle-wavelength (M-), and short-wavelength (S-) cones]. All other placental mammals are dichromats, and their color vision depends on the comparison of L- and S-cone signals; however, their cone-selective retinal circuitry is still unknown. Here, we identified the S-cone-selective (blue cone) bipolar cells of the mouse retina. They were labeled in a transgenic mouse expressing Clomeleon, a chloride-sensitive fluorescent protein, under the control of the thyl promoter. Blue-cone bipolar cells comprise only 1-2{\%} of the bipolar cell population, and their dendrites selectively contact S-opsin-expressing cones. In the dorsal half of the mouse retina, only 3-5{\%} of the coneis express S-opsin, and they are all contacted by blue-cone bipolar cells, whereas all L-opsin-expressing cones (∼95{\%}) are avoided. In the ventral mouse retina, the great majority of cones express both S- and L-opsin. They are not contacted by blue-cone bipolar cells. A minority of ventral cones express S-opsin only, and they are selectively contacted by blue-cone bipolar cells. We suggest that these are genuine S-cones. In contrast to the other cones, their pedicles contain only low amounts of cone arrestin. The blue-cone bipolar cells of the mouse retina and their cone selectivity are closely similar to primate blue-cone bipolars, and we suggest that they both represent the phylogenetically ancient color system of the mammalian retina.

abstract = {Reliable assessment of animal populations is a long-standing challenge in wildlife ecology. Technological advances have led to widespread adoption of camera traps (CTs) to survey wildlife distribution, abundance and behaviour. As for any wildlife survey method, camera trapping must contend with sources of sampling error such as imperfect detection. Early applications focused on density estimation of naturally marked species, but there is growing interest in broad-scale CT surveys of unmarked populations and communities. Nevertheless, inferences based on detection indices are controversial, and the suitability of alternatives such as occupancy estimation is debatable. We reviewed 266 CT studies published between 2008 and 2013. We recorded study objectives and methodologies, evaluating the consistency of CT protocols and sampling designs, the extent to which CT surveys considered sampling error, and the linkages between analytical assumptions and species ecology. Nearly two-thirds of studies surveyed more than one species, and a majority used response variables that ignored imperfect detection (e.g. presence-absence, relative abundance). Many studies used opportunistic sampling and did not explicitly report details of sampling design and camera deployment that could affect conclusions. Most studies estimating density used capture-recapture methods on marked species, with spatially explicit methods becoming more prominent. Few studies estimated density for unmarked species, focusing instead on occupancy modelling or measures of relative abundance. While occupancy studies estimated detectability, most did not explicitly define key components of the modelling framework (e.g. a site) or discuss potential violations of model assumptions (e.g. site closure). Studies using relative abundance relied on assumptions of equal detectability, and most did not explicitly define expected relationships between measured responses and underlying ecological processes (e.g. animal abundance and movement). Synthesis and applications. The rapid adoption of camera traps represents an exciting transition in wildlife survey methodology. We remain optimistic about the technology's promise, but call for more explicit consideration of underlying processes of animal abundance, movement and detection by cameras, including more thorough reporting of methodological details and assumptions. Such transparency will facilitate efforts to evaluate and improve the reliability of camera trap surveys, ultimately leading to stronger inferences and helping to meet modern needs for effective ecological inquiry and biodiversity monitoring.

abstract = {Analyses of life-history, ecological, and geographic trait differences among species, their causes, correlates, and likely consequences are increasingly important for understanding and conserving biodiversity in the face of rapid global change. Assembling multispecies trait data from diverse literature sources into a single comprehensive data set requires detailed consideration of methods to reliably compile data for particular species, and to derive single estimates from multiple sources based on different techniques and definitions. Here we describe PanTHERIA, a species-level data set compiled for analysis of life history, ecology, and geography of all known extant and recently extinct mammals. PanTHERIA is derived from a database capable of holding multiple geo-referenced values for variables within a species containing 100 740 lines of biological data for extant and recently extinct mammalian species, collected over a period of three years by 20 individuals. PanTHERIA also includes spatial databases of mammalian geographic ranges and global climatic and anthropogenic variables. Here we detail how the data fields are extracted and defined for PanTHERIA using a customized data input format (MammalForm); how data were collected from the literature, species names and sources tracked, error-checking and validation procedures applied, and how data were consolidated into species-level values for each variable. Tables of the consolidated species-level values are made available for each of two recent species-level taxonomic classifications of mammals, as well as associated taxonomic synonymy conversion and data-input files. This study provides a useful guide to prospective researchers on how to structure and codify life-history, ecological, geographic, and taxonomic data and methods to extract meaningful species-level traits. It also provides comprehensive information on traits like size, diet, environmental conditions, and ecology to permit macroecological and macroevolutionary analyses of this important clade.},

We applied non-spatial capture-recapture (CR) and spatial CR (SCR) models for Eurasian lynx during winter 2005/2006 in the northwestern Swiss Alps by sampling an area divided into 5 nested plots ranging from 65 to 760 km2. CR model density estimates (95{\%} CI) for models M0 and Mh decreased from 2.61 (1.55-3.68) and 3.6 (1.62-5.57) independent lynx/100 km2, respectively, in the smallest to 1.20 (1.04-1.35) and 1.26 (0.89-1.63) independent lynx/100 km2, respectively, in the largest area surveyed. SCR model density estimates also decreased with increasing sampling area but not significantly. High individual range overlaps in relatively small areas (the edge effect) is the most plausible reason for this positive bias in the CR models. Our results confirm that SCR models are much more robust to changes in trap array size than CR models, thus avoiding overestimation of density in smaller areas. However, when a study is concerned with monitoring population changes, large spatial efforts (area surveyed ≥760 km2) are required to obtain reliable and precise density estimates with these population densities and recapture rates. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd, ISZS and IOZ/CAS.},

abstract = {1. Estimates of density are not always independent of the area over which populations are censused. Instead, lower densities tend to be recorded for species when they are censused over larger areas. This may have serious implications for both intra- and interspecific comparisons of density, with relevance to such issues as conservation prioritization and management strategies, because differences in density may simply result from differences in census areas. 2. Here, we use long-term population census data for British birds in the period 196891, drawn from the Common Birds Census (CBC), to examine relationships between density and census area within species, and the consequences of these relationships for intraspecific and interspecific density comparisons. 3. Most British bird species exhibit statistically significant negative relationships between density and census area. We used these relationships to standardize mean density estimates for all species to a common census area. These area-adjusted estimates were usually very similar to geometric mean density estimates calculated without reference to census area. 4. For a subset of species recorded from a large number ({\textgreater} 30) of census sites in each year in the period 1968-91, we used intraspecific density-area relationships for each year to standardize mean density estimates to a common census area in all years. Again, the area-adjusted estimates for each year were usually very similar to the simple geometric mean density estimates calculated for the species in the same year. 5. These results are encouraging, but are certainly a consequence of the relatively limited range of census areas used here, and the fact that the mean census area varies little across species, or across years within species. Moreover, those species occupying few sites are the most likely to have area-biased densities, but are the species for which area-correction will be most difficult. 6. Overall, the results suggest that past analyses conducted using the CBC data are unlikely to have been seriously confounded by variation in census area. Nevertheless, they do highlight that the effects of census area will require consideration by anyone planning to measure or use densities for comparative purposes either within or among species.},

abstract = {Animals shape their activity in response to several processes that take place at different timescales. It stands to reason that the assessment of activity at multiple temporal scales will enhance the understanding of its patterns and determinants than studies that focus on a single scale. This thesis aimed to explore the patterns and drivers of the activity of the European badger (Meles meles) at three temporal scales: annual, seasonal and diel. I fitted occupancy models to data from camera traps collected continuously from different latitudes in Norway between 2015 and 2018. The results showed that activity patterns of the badgers were influenced by seasonality more significantly than by photoperiod, revealing plasticity in their temporal patterns to variation in environmental conditions. Season, temperature and time of the day had the strongest effect on activity levels, with badgers being more active in spring, during cold but not freezing days, and during night-time. Further, badgers in this study selected sites at lower latitude an altitude, and also closer to fields and human settlements. Overall, this study showed that scale is important for understanding the activity of species both in the long and short term. Further development of models considering both multiple temporal and spatial scales would offer more opportunities for enhancing the knowledge related to management and conservation of species.},

abstract = {Obtaining reliable species observations is of great importance in animal ecology and wildlife conservation. An increasing number of studies use camera traps (CTs) to study wildlife communities, and an increasing effort is made to make better use and reuse of the large amounts of data that are produced. It is in these circumstances that it becomes paramount to correct for the species- and study-specific variation in imperfect detection within CTs. We reviewed the literature and used our own experience to compile a list of factors that affect CT detection of animals. We did this within a conceptual framework of six distinct scales separating out the influences of (a) animal characteristics, (b) CT specifications, (c) CT set-up protocols, and (d) environmental variables. We identified 40 factors that can potentially influence the detection of animals by CTs at these six scales. Many of these factors were related to only a few overarching parameters. Most of the animal characteristics scale with body mass and diet type, and most environmental characteristics differ with season or latitude such that remote sensing products like NDVI could be used as a proxy index to capture this variation. Factors that influence detection at the microsite and camera scales are probably the most important in determining CT detection of animals. The type of study and specific research question will determine which factors should be corrected. Corrections can be done by directly adjusting the CT metric of interest or by using covariates in a statistical framework. Our conceptual framework can be used to design better CT studies and help when analyzing CT data. Furthermore, it provides an overview of which factors should be reported in CT studies to make them repeatable, comparable, and their data reusable. This should greatly improve the possibilities for global scale analyses of (reused) CT data.},

abstract = {Practical techniques are required to monitor invasive animals, which are often cryptic and occur at low density. Camera traps have potential for this purpose, but may have problems detecting and identifying small species. A further challenge is how to standardise the size of each camera's field of view so capture rates are comparable between different places and times. We investigated the optimal specifications for a low-cost camera trap for small mammals. The factors tested were 1) trigger speed, 2) passive infrared vs. microwave sensor, 3) white vs. infrared flash, and 4) still photographs vs. video. We also tested a new approach to standardise each camera's field of view. We compared the success rates of four camera trap designs in detecting and taking recognisable photographs of captive stoats (Mustela erminea), feral cats (Felis catus) and hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus). Trigger speeds of 0.2-2.1 s captured photographs of all three target species unless the animal was running at high speed. The camera with a microwave sensor was prone to false triggers, and often failed to trigger when an animal moved in front of it. A white flash produced photographs that were more readily identified to species than those obtained under infrared light. However, a white flash may be more likely to frighten target animals, potentially affecting detection probabilities. Video footage achieved similar success rates to still cameras but required more processing time and computer memory. Placing two camera traps side by side achieved a higher success rate than using a single camera. Camera traps show considerable promise for monitoring invasive mammal control operations. Further research should address how best to standardise the size of each camera's field of view, maximise the probability that an animal encountering a camera trap will be detected, and eliminate visible or audible cues emitted by camera traps. {\textcopyright} 2013 Glen et al.},
