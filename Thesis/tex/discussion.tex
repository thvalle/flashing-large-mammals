\section{Overlap analysis}

Proportion of foxes at sites were markedly lower before sunrise, and then higher afterwards. 
Could this simply be because of a lower detection rate when lacking the additional white flash? 

The Dhat4 calculation reveals a larger difference in overlap for foxes, than for roe deer, but this seems to mainly stem from the twilight hours. Thus, the scores could result from the different size and detection rates of the two species, rather than an actual reaction to the white LED.

%POST-IT
%% Physiological features of species could determine effect: badgers poor eye sight -> less reactive to visual stimuli?
%%Species interaction with human: high conflict animals wary of flash as it signals humans nearby
%%Camera site proximity to urban area/ roads (Artificial Light At Night) : +correlation with proximity and effect on species
%%smaller animals less likely to be detected by camera. Dark numbers?
