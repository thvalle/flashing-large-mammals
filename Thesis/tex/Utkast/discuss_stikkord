Discussion
_____________________________
Why did I do what I did?

-CT growing popularity
	-wLED to capt-recapt
-potential bias in detect rates
-I put wLED on IR CTs on/off 
-wLED seems to have small effect
	~all non-significant
_____________________________
What does it mean considering theory and/or other studies?

-Most species consist of individuals with a robust psyche
	-(less neurotic than I expected)

Can you generalize?

Strong and weak sides of my study
/ Discussing method

-Study design
	- 60 sites vs 40 (exclude ctrl)
	   -shorter field work
	   -LED-moving quicker
	- Include data from previous year?
-Analysis
   -Scaling of Time variable
	-increased estimate and SE
	-H0 undecided
   -More random-effects?
	-CT height, habitat etc
	 -maybe wouldnt affect fix.eff R2

Implications for practice?

-as have been noted by many; not for behaviour
	-(stating the obvious, as we want to be a "fly on the wall" in atferd-studies
-If anything, beware attractant effects first week of LED (ref. surv-plots)
-No implication for occupancy (presence\absence)
-Possible implication for SCaptRecapt(SCR)


____________________________
More research needed?

-Some times a species can avoid the lens
  -for me in particular, the LED could've scared individuals off even before they entered the IR frame (Browning trigger!).
     -other studies could try to couple a lagging(!) LED-flash to an IR(/black) CT
	-thus allowing for a detection before the white light stimuli
-SCR setup with multiple CT flash-types, noting whether individuals avoid the white flash CTs
