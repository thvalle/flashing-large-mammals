%\subsection{General results}
%
%After excluding faulty cameras we had TK cameras in total, 19 in the Control-group and 33 in the experiment group.
%A total of TK photos were taken, of whom TK contained photos of the species I've focused on in my study. Check table for more details.
%
%The species I've focused on was mainly night-active as displayed in the density plots \ref{fig:overlap}, (with the exception of squirrel). In other words, all of them experienced a white LED flash during night hours.
%(Caption: Figure is split up in periods with and without white LED flash. Night activity in the dashed curve highlights the times the species would have experienced the flash. "Carpet"-below the curves signifies datapoints of each "group".

%\section{All species} %AMkomm: Title needs to say something more

As the control-group (Intercept in table \ref{tab:param}) stayed unchanged through the whole study period, and was visited less than the other cameras, I expected there to be no trend over time (i.e. time.deploy $\approx 0$ in table \ref{tab:param}).
Any fluctuations in detection rates due to weekly (and ultimately seasonal) changes should be controlled for by the random effect-term for week of the year, leaving the control group as a representation of the baseline detection rate.
This held true for all the species in my analysis.

In general, the control-group had lower detection rates than the two treatment groups for all species (see table \ref{tab:param}).
However, for most species, the slopes of IR and LED are completely covered by the Control-group's confidence interval (CI), meaning that the differences are non-significant.


If there were any effect of the LED, the IR period should show a regression to the norm, ie. counteracting the effect of the LED.
Thus, if the LED had a negative slope along the time axis, the IR should have a positive slope.
Further, their respective main effects (ie. when time since deployment = 0) should correspond somewhat to the other factor's simple effect of when time since deployment is at maximum value (84 days).
Still, as time since deployment = 0 corresponds to the day of my visitation, my presence could skew that pattern to some extent.

The main effect of LED was positive for most species, although none responded significantly (table \ref{tab:param}).

\end{figure}


For roe deer, the model explaining variation in detection rate has a substantial explanatory power (conditional R2 = 0.45), but the part related to the fixed effects alone (marginal R2) is just 0.002.
In other words, most of the explained variation in detection rate is due to seasonal changes and variation between the different camera sites captured in the random terms.

The main effect of the white LED periods were non-significantly positive compared to the control-group (Intercept).
The same is true for the IR periods, although to a slightly lower extent.
However, along the time since deployment-axis (time.deploy $\ast$ flash [LED]) there was a negative effect, to the extent that after two months the mean detection rate sank below that of the IR periods (see figure \ref{fig:raadyr}a).
Nevertheless, the confidence intervals (CI) of both white LED and IR periods almost completely overlap, and hence, are not significantly different.


When a parameter is within the ROPE in an equivalence test, it signifies that the difference from the Log-mean, and the variance of the parameter, is low enough that we can accept H0, rather than just fail to reject it.

According to this test, white LED is different enough that we cannot conclude on it’s main effect, but it’s trend over time (Time * LED) is practically equivalent to H0. 
In other words, the equivalence test suggests that there is no significant difference in the long run, but there might be an increase in detections right after the day of deployment.
However, the increase could also result from inhereting a slightly higher detection rate from the IR periods \emph{if} there truly is a negative effect of the white LED over long periods of time.

For red fox, the model explaining variation in detection rate has a moderate explanatory power (conditional R2 = 0.19), and the part related to the fixed effects alone (marginal R2) is just 0.001. 


The main effect of the white LED periods were non-significantly positive (flash[LED] in table \ref{tab:param}) compared to the IR- and control-periods (flash[IR];Intercept) .
However, along the time since deployment-axis (time.deploy $\ast$ flash [LED]) there was a negative effect, to the extent that after two months the mean detection rate sank below that of the IR periods (see figure \ref{fig:raadyr}a).
Nevertheless, CI of both white LED and IR periods almost completely overlap, and hence, are not significantly different.
