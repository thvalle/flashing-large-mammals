\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I always assumed that writing a long text would be straightforward. One sits down and writes from start to finish, and then what remains to do is simply to check for misspellings.
However, writing this thesis, I've learned that this is far from the truth, as both my supervisors and myself had trouble understanding some of the sections I've written along the way.

%To understand much of this myself, I had to dive deep into the statistics. However, it is quite difficult to understand someone talking at the bottom of the sea, and so, my supervisors had to drag me up and out of the water.

Finally, after many attempts, my thesis is hopefully coherent for anyone wanting (or having) to read it.

Thanks to my supervisors Atle Mysterud, John Odden, Neri Thorsen and Inger Maren Rivrud.

Atle, thank you for making me focus on the positives and motivate me to keep going...
John, thank you for giving me the opportunity to work on a project related to lynx (although it evaded me... )
Neri, thank you for all the help with data wrangling and setting up my analyses. After a while I was able to understand your <codes>.
Inger Maren, thank you for the advice in writing...

During several hundred hours of field work, I was lucky enough to bring some friends along the way.
I want to thank all my friends that joined me for a day in the field, and a speciel thanks to Olav Rørstad, who joined me for several weeks. Two idiots were better than one, when the car got stuck in an uphill, snowy, dirt road (or two).
